    "passage_1 = \"LANGDON FELT FIRM hands lifting him now … urging him from his delirium, helping him out ofthe taxi. The pavement felt cold beneath his bare feet.Half supported by the slender frame of Dr. Brooks, Langdon staggered down a desertedwalkway between two apartment buildings. The dawn air rustled, billowing his hospitalgown, and Langdon felt cold air in places he knew he shouldn’t.The sedative he’d been given in the hospital had left his mind as blurred as his vision.Langdon felt like he was underwater, attempting to claw his way through a viscous, dimlylit world. Sienna Brooks dragged him onward, supporting him with surprising strength.“Stairs,” she said, and Langdon realized they had reached a side entrance of thebuilding.Langdon gripped the railing and trudged dizzily upward, one step at a time. His bodyfelt ponderous. Dr. Brooks physically pushed him now. When they reached the landing,she typed some numbers into a rusted old keypad and the door buzzed open.The air inside was not much warmer, but the tile floors felt like soft carpet on the solesof his feet compared to the rough pavement outside. Dr. Brooks led Langdon to a tinyelevator and yanked open a folding door, herding Langdon into a cubicle that was aboutthe size of a phone booth. The air inside smelled of MS cigarettes—a bittersweetfragrance as ubiquitous in Italy as the aroma of fresh espresso. Ever so slightly, the smellhelped clear Langdon’s mind. Dr. Brooks pressed a button, and somewhere high abovethem, a series of tired gears clunked and whirred into motion.Upward …The creaky carriage shimmied and vibrated as it began its ascent. Because the wallswere nothing but metal screens, Langdon found himself watching the inside of theelevator shaft slide rhythmically past them. Even in his semiconscious state, Langdon’slifelong fear of cramped spaces was alive and well.Don’t look.He leaned on the wall, trying to catch his breath. His forearm ached, and when helooked down, he saw that the sleeve of his Harris Tweed had been tied awkwardlyaround his arm like a bandage. The remainder of the jacket was dragging behind him onthe ground, frayed and filthy.He closed his eyes against his pounding headache, but the blackness engulfed himagain.A familiar vision materialized—the statuesque, veiled woman with the amulet andsilver hair in ringlets. As before, she was on the banks of a bloodred river and surroundedby writhing bodies. She spoke to Langdon, her voice pleading. Seek and ye shall find!Langdon was overcome with the feeling that he had to save her … save them all. Thehalf-buried, upside-down legs were falling limp … one by one.Who are you!? he called out in silence. What do you want?!Her luxuriant silver hair began fluttering in a hot wind. Our time grows short, shewhispered, touching her amulet necklace. Then, without warning, she erupted in ablinding pillar of fire, which billowed across the river, engulfing them both.Langdon shouted, his eyes flying open.Dr. Brooks eyed him with concern. “What is it?”“I keep hallucinating!” Langdon exclaimed. “The same scene.”“The silver-haired woman? And all the dead bodies?”Langdon nodded, perspiration beading on his brow.“You’ll be okay,” she assured him, despite sounding shaky herself. “Recurring visionsare common with amnesia. The brain function that sorts and catalogs your memories hasbeen temporarily shaken up, and so it throws everything into one picture.”“Not a very nice picture,” he managed.“I know, but until you heal, your memories will be muddled and uncataloged—past,present, and imagination all mixed together. The same thing happens in dreams.”The elevator lurched to a stop, and Dr. Brooks yanked open the folding door. Theywere walking again, this time down a dark, narrow corridor. They passed a window,outside of which the murky silhouettes of Florence rooftops had begun emerging in thepredawn light. At the far end of the hall, she crouched down and retrieved a key frombeneath a thirsty-looking houseplant and unlocked a door.The apartment was tiny, the air inside hinting at an ongoing battle between a vanilla-scented candle and old carpeting. The furniture and artwork were meager at best—as ifshe had furnished it at a yard sale. Dr. Brooks adjusted a thermostat, and the radiatorsbanged to life.She stood a moment and closed her eyes, exhaling heavily, as if to collect herself. Thenshe turned and helped Langdon into a modest kitchenette whose Formica table had twoflimsy chairs.Langdon made a move toward a chair in hopes of sitting down, but Dr. Brooks grabbedhis arm with one hand and opened a cabinet with her other. The cabinet was nearly bare… crackers, a few bags of pasta, a can of Coke, and a bottle of NoDoz.She took out the bottle and dumped six caplets into Langdon’s palm. “Caffeine,” shesaid. “For when I work night shifts like tonight.”Langdon put the pills in his mouth and glanced around for some water.“Chew them,” she said. “They’ll hit your system faster and help counteract thesedative.”Langdon began chewing and instantly cringed. The pills were bitter, clearly meant tobe swallowed whole. Dr. Brooks opened the refrigerator and handed Langdon a half-empty bottle of San Pellegrino. He gratefully took a long drink.The ponytailed doctor now took his right arm and removed the makeshift bandage thatshe’d fashioned out of his jacket, which she laid on the kitchen table. Then she carefullyexamined his wound. As she held his bare arm, Langdon could feel her slender handstrembling“You’ll live,” she announced.Langdon hoped she was going to be okay. He could barely fathom what they’d bothjust endured. “Dr. Brooks,” he said, “we need to call somebody. The consulate … thepolice. Somebody.”She nodded in agreement. “Also, you can stop calling me Dr. Brooks—my name isSienna.”Langdon nodded. “Thanks. I’m Robert.” It seemed the bond they’d just forged fleeingfor their lives warranted a first-name basis. “You said you’re British?”“By birth, yes.”“I don’t hear an accent.”“Good,” she replied. “I worked hard to lose it.”Langdon was about to inquire why, but Sienna motioned for him to follow. She led himdown a narrow corridor to a small, gloomy bathroom. In the mirror above the sink,Langdon glimpsed his reflection for the first time since seeing it in the window of hishospital room.Not good. Langdon’s thick dark hair was matted, and his eyes looked bloodshot andweary. A shroud of stubble obscured his jaw.Sienna turned on the faucet and guided Langdon’s injured forearm under the ice-coldwater. It stung sharply, but he held it there, wincing.Sienna retrieved a fresh washcloth and squirted it with antibacterial soap. “You maywant to look away.”“It’s fine. I’m not bothered by—”Sienna began scrubbing violently, and white-hot pain shot up Langdon’s arm. Heclenched his jaw to prevent himself from shouting out in protest.“You don’t want an infection,” she said, scrubbing harder now. “Besides, if you’re goingto call the authorities, you’ll want to be more alert than you are now. Nothing activatesadrenaline production like pain.”Langdon held on for what felt like a full ten seconds of scrubbing before he forcefullyyanked his arm away. Enough! Admittedly, he felt stronger and more awake; the pain his arm had now entirely overshadowed his headache.“Good,” she said, turning off the water and patting his arm dry with a clean towel.Sienna then applied a small bandage to his forearm, but as she did so, Langdon foundhimself distracted by something he had just noticed—something deeply upsetting to him.For nearly four decades, Langdon had worn an antique collector’s edition Mickey Moustimepiece, a gift from his parents. Mickey’s smiling face and wildly waving arms hadalways served as his daily reminder to smile more often and take life a little lessseriously.“My … watch,” Langdon stammered. “It’s gone!” Without it, he felt suddenlyincomplete. “Was I wearing it when I arrived at the hospital?”Sienna shot him an incredulous look, clearly mystified that he could be worried aboutsuch a trivial thing. “I don’t remember any watch. Just clean yourself up. I’ll be back in afew minutes and we’ll figure out how to get you some help.” She turned to go, butpaused in the doorway, locking eyes with him in the mirror. “And while I’m gone, Isuggest you think very hard about why someone would want to kill you. I imagine it’s thefirst question the authorities will ask.”“Wait, where are you going?”“You can’t talk to the police half naked. I’m going to find you some clothes. Myneighbor is about your size. He’s away, and I’m feeding his cat. He owes me.”With that, Sienna was gone.Robert Langdon turned back to the tiny mirror over the sink and barely recognized theperson staring back at him. Someone wants me dead. In his mind, he again heard therecording of his own delirious mumblings.Very sorry. Very sorry.He probed his memory for some recollection … anything at all. He saw only emptiness.All Langdon knew was that he was in Florence, having suffered a bullet wound to thehead.As Langdon stared into his own weary eyes, he half wondered if he might at anymoment wake up in his reading chair at home, clutching an empty martini glass and acopy of Dead Souls, only to remind himself that Bombay Sapphire and Gogol should never\"\n",

    "passage_2 = \"I’M IN FLORENCE!? Robert Langdon’s head throbbed. He was now seated upright in his hospital bed,repeatedly jamming his finger into the call button. Despite the sedatives in his system,his heart was racing.Dr. Brooks hurried back in, her ponytail bobbing. “Are you okay?”Langdon shook his head in bewilderment. “I’m in … Italy!?”“Good,” she said. “You’re remembering.”“No!” Langdon pointed out the window at the commanding edifice in the distance. “Irecognize the Palazzo Vecchio.”Dr. Brooks flicked the lights back on, and the Florence skyline disappeared. She cameto his bedside, whispering calmly. “Mr. Langdon, there’s no need to worry. You’resuffering from mild amnesia, but Dr. Marconi confirmed that your brain function is fine.”The bearded doctor rushed in as well, apparently hearing the call button. He checkedLangdon’s heart monitor as the young doctor spoke to him in rapid, fluent Italian—something about how Langdon was “agitato” to learn he was in Italy.Agitated? Langdon thought angrily. More like stupefied! The adrenaline surging throughhis system was now doing battle with the sedatives. “What happened to me?” hedemanded. “What day is it?!”“Everything is fine,” she said. “It’s early morning. Monday, March eighteenth.”Monday. Langdon forced his aching mind to reel back to the last images he could recall—cold and dark—walking alone across the Harvard campus to a Saturday-night lectureseries. That was two days ago?! A sharper panic now gripped him as he tried to recallanything at all from the lecture or afterward. Nothing. The ping of his heart monitoraccelerated.The older doctor scratched at his beard and continued adjusting equipment while Dr.Brooks sat again beside Langdon.“You’re going to be okay,” she reassured him, speaking gently. “We’ve diagnosed youwith retrograde amnesia, which is very common in head trauma. Your memories of thepast few days may be muddled or missing, but you should suffer no permanent damage.”She paused. “Do you remember my first name? I told you when I walked in.”Langdon thought a moment. “Sienna.” Dr. Sienna Brooks.She smiled. “See? You’re already forming new memories.”The pain in Langdon’s head was almost unbearable, and his near-field vision remainedblurry. “What … happened? How did I get here?”“I think you should rest, and maybe—”“How did I get here?!” he demanded, his heart monitor accelerating further.“Okay, just breathe easy,” Dr. Brooks said, exchanging a nervous look with hercolleague. “I’ll tell you.” Her voice turned markedly more serious. “Mr. Langdon, threehours ago, you staggered into our emergency room, bleeding from a head wound, andyou immediately collapsed. Nobody had any idea who you were or how you got here. Youwere mumbling in English, so Dr. Marconi asked me to assist. I’m on sabbatical here fromthe U.K.”Langdon felt like he had awoken inside a Max Ernst painting. What the hell am I doingin Italy? Normally Langdon came here every other June for an art conference, but thiswas March.The sedatives pulled harder at him now, and he felt as if earth’s gravity were growingstronger by the second, trying to drag him down through his mattress. Langdon fought it,hoisting his head, trying to stay alert.Dr. Brooks leaned over him, hovering like an angel. “Please, Mr. Langdon,” shewhispered. “Head trauma is delicate in the first twenty-four hours. You need to rest, oryou could do serious damage.”A voice crackled suddenly on the room’s intercom. “Dr. Marconi?”The bearded doctor touched a button on the wall and replied, “Sì?”The voice on the intercom spoke in rapid Italian. Langdon didn’t catch what it said, buthe did catch the two doctors exchanging a look of surprise. Or is it alarm?“Momento,” Marconi replied, ending the conversation.“What’s going on?” Langdon asked.Dr. Brooks’s eyes seemed to narrow a bit. “That was the ICU receptionist. Someone’shere to visit you.”A ray of hope cut through Langdon’s grogginess. “That’s good news! Maybe this personknows what happened to me.”She looked uncertain. “It’s just odd that someone’s here. We didn’t have your name,and you’re not even registered in the system yet.”Langdon battled the sedatives and awkwardly hoisted himself upright in his bed. “Ifsomeone knows I’m here, that person must know what happened!”Dr. Brooks glanced at Dr. Marconi, who immediately shook his head and tapped hiswatch. She turned back to Langdon.“This is the ICU,” she explained. “Nobody is allowed in until nine A.M. at the earliest. Ina moment Dr. Marconi will go out and see who the visitor is and what he or she wants.”“What about what I want?” Langdon demanded.Dr. Brooks smiled patiently and lowered her voice, leaning closer. “Mr. Langdon, thereare some things you don’t know about last night … about what happened to you. Andbefore you speak to anyone, I think it’s only fair that you have all the facts.Unfortunately, I don’t think you’re strong enough yet to—”“What facts!?” Langdon demanded, struggling to prop himself higher. The IV in his armpinched, and his body felt like it weighed several hundred pounds. “All I know is I’m in aFlorence hospital and I arrived repeating the words ‘very sorry …’ ”A frightening thought now occurred to him.“Was I responsible for a car accident?” Langdon asked. “Did I hurt someone?!”“No, no,” she said. “I don’t believe so.”“Then what?” Langdon insisted, eyeing both doctors furiously. “I have a right to knowwhat’s going on!”There was a long silence, and Dr. Marconi finally gave his attractive young colleague areluctant nod. Dr. Brooks exhaled and moved closer to his bedside. “Okay, let me tell youwhat I know … and you’ll listen calmly, agreed?”Langdon nodded, the head movement sending a jolt of pain radiating through his skull.He ignored it, eager for answers.“The first thing is this … Your head wound was not caused by an accident.”“Well, that’s a relief.”“Not really. Your wound, in fact, was caused by a bullet.”Langdon’s heart monitor pinged faster. “I beg your pardon!?”Dr. Brooks spoke steadily but quickly. “A bullet grazed the top of your skull and mostlikely gave you a concussion. You’re very lucky to be alive. An inch lower, and …” Sheshook her head.Langdon stared at her in disbelief. Someone shot me?Angry voices erupted in the hall as an argument broke out. It sounded as if whoeverhad arrived to visit Langdon did not want to wait. Almost immediately, Langdon heard aheavy door at the far end of the hallway burst open. He watched until he saw a figureapproaching down the corridor.The woman was dressed entirely in black leather. She was toned and strong with dark,spiked hair. She moved effortlessly, as if her feet weren’t touching the ground, and shewas headed directly for Langdon’s room.Without hesitation, Dr. Marconi stepped into the open doorway to block the visitor’spassage. “Ferma!” the man commanded, holding out his palm like a policeman.The stranger, without breaking stride, produced a silenced handgun. She aimed directlyat Dr. Marconi’s chest and fired.There was a staccato hiss.Langdon watched in horror as Dr. Marconi staggered backward into the room, falling tothe floor, clutching his chest, his white lab coat drenched in blood.\"\n",

    "passage_3 = \"Snaking through heavy crowds on the Riva degli Schiavoni, Langdon, Sienna, and Ferris hugged the water’s edge, making their way into St. Mark’s Square and arriving at its southernmost border, the edge where the piazza met the sea. Here the throng of tourists was almost impenetrable, creating a claustrophobic crush around Langdon as the multitudes gravitated over to photograph the two massive columns that stood here, framing the square. The official gateway to the city, Langdon thought ironically, knowing the spot had also been used for public executions until as late as the eighteenth century. Atop one of the gateway’s columns, he could see a bizarre statue of St. Theodore, posing proudly with his slain dragon of legendary repute, which always looked to Langdon much more like a crocodile. Atop the second column stood the ubiquitous symbol of Venice—the winged lion. Throughout the city, the winged lion could be seen with his paw resting proudly on an open book bearing the Latin inscription Pax tibi Marce, evangelista meus (May Peace Be with You, Mark, My Evangelist). According to legend, these words were spoken by an angel upon St. Mark’s arrival in Venice, along with the prediction that his body would one day rest here. This apocryphal legend was later used by Venetians to justify plundering St. Mark’s bones from Alexandria for reburial in St. Mark’s Basilica. To this day, the winged lion endures as the city’s symbol and is visible at nearly every turn. Langdon motioned to his right, past the columns, across St. Mark’s Square. “If we get separated, meet at the front door of the basilica.” The others agreed and quickly began skirting the edges of the crowd and following the western wall of the Doge’s Palace into the square. Despite the laws forbidding feeding them, the celebrated pigeons of Venice appeared to be alive and well, some pecking about at the feet of the crowds and others swooping into the outdoor cafés to pillage unprotected bread baskets and torment the tuxedoed waiters. This grand piazza, unlike most in Europe, was shaped not in the form of a square but rather in that of the letter L. The shorter leg—known as the piazzetta—connected the ocean to St. Mark’s Basilica. Up ahead, the square took a ninety-degree left turn into its larger leg, which ran from the basilica toward the Museo Correr. Strangely, rather than being rectilinear, the square was an irregular trapezoid, narrowing substantially at one end. This fun-house-type illusion made the piazza look far longer than it was, an effect that was accentuated by the grid of tiles whose patterns outlined the original stalls of fifteenth-century street merchants. As Langdon continued on toward the elbow of the square, he could see, directly ahead in the distance, the shimmering blue glass dial of the St. Mark’s Clock Tower—the same astronomical clock through which James Bond had thrown a villain in the film Moonraker. It was not until this moment, as he entered the sheltered square, that Langdon could fully appreciate this city’s most unique offering: sound. With virtually no cars or motorized vehicles of any kind, Venice enjoyed a blissful absence of the usual civic traffic, subways, and sirens, leaving sonic space for the distinctly unmechanical tapestry of human voices, cooing pigeons, and lilting violins serenading patrons at the outdoor cafés. Venice sounded like no other metropolitan center in the world. As the late-afternoon sun streamed into St. Mark’s from the west, casting long shadows across the tiled square, Langdon glanced up at the towering spire of the campanile, which rose high over the square and dominated the ancient Venetian skyline. The upper loggia of the tower was packed with hundreds of people. Even the mere thought of being up there made him shiver, and he put his head back down and continued through the sea of humanity. Sienna could easily have kept up with Langdon, but Ferris was lagging behind, and Sienna had decided to split the difference in order to keep both men in sight. Now, however, as the distance between them grew more pronounced, she looked back impatiently. Ferris pointed to his chest, indicating he was winded, and motioned for her to go on ahead. Sienna complied, moving quickly after Langdon and losing sight of Ferris. Yet as she wove her way through the crowd, a nagging feeling held her back—the strange suspicion that Ferris was lagging behind intentionally … as if he were trying to put distance between them. Having learned long ago to trust her instincts, Sienna ducked into an alcove and looked out from the shadows, scanning the crowd behind her and looking for Ferris. Where did he go?! It was as if he were no longer even trying to follow them. Sienna studied the faces in the crowd, and finally she saw him. To her surprise, Ferris had stopped and was crouched low, typing into his phone. The same phone he told me had a dead battery. A visceral fear gripped her, and again she knew she should trust it. He lied to me on the train. As Sienna watched him, she tried to imagine what he was doing. Secretly texting someone? Researching behind her back? Trying to solve the mystery of Zobrist’s poem before Langdon and Sienna could do so? Whatever his rationale, he had blatantly lied to her. I can’t trust him. Sienna wondered if she should storm over and confront him, but she quickly decided to slip back into the crowd before he spotted her. She headed again toward the basilica, searching for Langdon. I’ve got to warn him not to reveal anything else to Ferris. She was only fifty yards from the basilica when she felt a strong hand tugging on her sweater from behind. She spun around and found herself face-to-face with Ferris. The man with the rash was panting heavily, clearly having dashed through the mob to catch up with her. There was a frantic quality about him that Sienna hadn’t seen before. “Sorry,” he said, barely able to breathe. “I got lost in the crowd.” The instant Sienna looked in his eyes, she knew. He’s hiding something. When Langdon arrived in front of St. Mark’s Basilica, he was surprised to discover that his two companions were no longer behind him. Also of surprise to Langdon was the absence of a line of tourists waiting to enter the church. Then again, Langdon realized, this was late afternoon in Venice, the hour when most tourists—their energy flagging from heavy lunches of pasta and wine—decided to stroll the piazzas or sip coffee rather than trying to absorb any more history. Assuming that Sienna and Ferris would be arriving at any moment, Langdon turned his eyes to the entrance of the basilica before him. Sometimes accused of offering “an embarrassing surfeit of ingress,” the building’s lower facade was almost entirely taken up by a phalanx of five recessed entrances whose clustered columns, vaulted archways, and gaping bronze doors arguably made the building, if nothing else, eminently welcoming. One of Europe’s finest specimens of Byzantine architecture, St. Mark’s had a decidedly soft and whimsical appearance. In contrast to the austere gray towers of Notre-Dame or Chartres, St. Mark’s seemed imposing and yet, somehow, far more down-to-earth. Wider than it was tall, the church was topped by five bulging whitewashed domes that exuded an airy, almost festive appearance, causing more than a few of the guidebooks to compare St. Mark’s to a meringue-topped wedding cake. High atop the central peak of the church, a slender statue of St. Mark gazed down into the square that bore his name. His feet rested atop a crested arch that was painted midnight blue and dotted with golden stars. Against this colorful backdrop, the golden winged lion of Venice stood as the shimmering mascot of the city. It was beneath the golden lion, however, that St. Mark’s displayed one of its most famous treasures—four mammoth copper stallions—which at the moment were glinting in the afternoon sun. The Horses of St. Mark’s. Poised as if prepared to leap down at any moment into the square, these four priceless stallions—like so many treasures here in Venice—had been pillaged from Constantinople during the Crusades. Another similarly looted work of art was on display beneath the horses at the southwest corner of the church—a purple porphyry carving known as The Tetrarchs. The statue was well known for its missing foot, broken off while it was being plundered from Constantinople in the thirteenth century. Miraculously, in the 1960s, the foot was unearthed in Istanbul. Venice petitioned for the missing piece of statue, but the Turkish authorities replied with a simple message: You stole the statue—we’re keeping our foot. “Mister, you buy?” a woman’s voice said, drawing Langdon’s gaze downward. A heavyset Gypsy woman was holding up a tall pole on which hung a collection of Venetian masks. Most were in the popular volto intero style—the stylized full-faced, white masks often worn by women during Carnevale. Her collection also contained some playful half-faced Colombina masks, a few triangle-chinned bautas, and a strapless Moretta. Despite her colorful offerings, though, it was a single, grayish-black mask at the top of the pole that seized Langdon’s attention, its menacing dead eyes seeming to stare directly down at him over a long, beaked nose. The plague doctor. Langdon averted his eyes, needing no reminder of what he was doing here in Venice. “You buy?” the Gypsy repeated. Langdon smiled weakly and shook his head. “Sono molto belle, ma no, grazie.” As the woman departed, Langdon’s gaze followed the ominous plague mask as it bobbed above the crowd. He sighed heavily and raised his eyes back to the four copper stallions on the second-floor balcony. In a flash, it hit him. Langdon felt a sudden rush of elements crashing together—Horses of St. Mark’s, Venetian masks, and pillaged treasures from Constantinople. “My God,” he whispered. That’s it!\" "

    "passage_1 = \"LANGDON FELT FIRM hands lifting him now … urging him from his delirium, helping him out ofthe taxi. The pavement felt cold beneath his bare feet.Half supported by the slender frame of Dr. Brooks, Langdon staggered down a desertedwalkway between two apartment buildings. The dawn air rustled, billowing his hospitalgown, and Langdon felt cold air in places he knew he shouldn’t.The sedative he’d been given in the hospital had left his mind as blurred as his vision.Langdon felt like he was underwater, attempting to claw his way through a viscous, dimlylit world. Sienna Brooks dragged him onward, supporting him with surprising strength.“Stairs,” she said, and Langdon realized they had reached a side entrance of thebuilding.Langdon gripped the railing and trudged dizzily upward, one step at a time. His bodyfelt ponderous. Dr. Brooks physically pushed him now. When they reached the landing,she typed some numbers into a rusted old keypad and the door buzzed open.The air inside was not much warmer, but the tile floors felt like soft carpet on the solesof his feet compared to the rough pavement outside. Dr. Brooks led Langdon to a tinyelevator and yanked open a folding door, herding Langdon into a cubicle that was aboutthe size of a phone booth. The air inside smelled of MS cigarettes—a bittersweetfragrance as ubiquitous in Italy as the aroma of fresh espresso. Ever so slightly, the smellhelped clear Langdon’s mind. Dr. Brooks pressed a button, and somewhere high abovethem, a series of tired gears clunked and whirred into motion.Upward …The creaky carriage shimmied and vibrated as it began its ascent. Because the wallswere nothing but metal screens, Langdon found himself watching the inside of theelevator shaft slide rhythmically past them. Even in his semiconscious state, Langdon’slifelong fear of cramped spaces was alive and well.Don’t look.He leaned on the wall, trying to catch his breath. His forearm ached, and when helooked down, he saw that the sleeve of his Harris Tweed had been tied awkwardlyaround his arm like a bandage. The remainder of the jacket was dragging behind him onthe ground, frayed and filthy.He closed his eyes against his pounding headache, but the blackness engulfed himagain.A familiar vision materialized—the statuesque, veiled woman with the amulet andsilver hair in ringlets. As before, she was on the banks of a bloodred river and surroundedby writhing bodies. She spoke to Langdon, her voice pleading. Seek and ye shall find!Langdon was overcome with the feeling that he had to save her … save them all. Thehalf-buried, upside-down legs were falling limp … one by one.Who are you!? he called out in silence. What do you want?!Her luxuriant silver hair began fluttering in a hot wind. Our time grows short, shewhispered, touching her amulet necklace. Then, without warning, she erupted in ablinding pillar of fire, which billowed across the river, engulfing them both.Langdon shouted, his eyes flying open.Dr. Brooks eyed him with concern. “What is it?”“I keep hallucinating!” Langdon exclaimed. “The same scene.”“The silver-haired woman? And all the dead bodies?”Langdon nodded, perspiration beading on his brow.“You’ll be okay,” she assured him, despite sounding shaky herself. “Recurring visionsare common with amnesia. The brain function that sorts and catalogs your memories hasbeen temporarily shaken up, and so it throws everything into one picture.”“Not a very nice picture,” he managed.“I know, but until you heal, your memories will be muddled and uncataloged—past,present, and imagination all mixed together. The same thing happens in dreams.”The elevator lurched to a stop, and Dr. Brooks yanked open the folding door. Theywere walking again, this time down a dark, narrow corridor. They passed a window,outside of which the murky silhouettes of Florence rooftops had begun emerging in thepredawn light. At the far end of the hall, she crouched down and retrieved a key frombeneath a thirsty-looking houseplant and unlocked a door.The apartment was tiny, the air inside hinting at an ongoing battle between a vanilla-scented candle and old carpeting. The furniture and artwork were meager at best—as ifshe had furnished it at a yard sale. Dr. Brooks adjusted a thermostat, and the radiatorsbanged to life.She stood a moment and closed her eyes, exhaling heavily, as if to collect herself. Thenshe turned and helped Langdon into a modest kitchenette whose Formica table had twoflimsy chairs.Langdon made a move toward a chair in hopes of sitting down, but Dr. Brooks grabbedhis arm with one hand and opened a cabinet with her other. The cabinet was nearly bare… crackers, a few bags of pasta, a can of Coke, and a bottle of NoDoz.She took out the bottle and dumped six caplets into Langdon’s palm. “Caffeine,” shesaid. “For when I work night shifts like tonight.”Langdon put the pills in his mouth and glanced around for some water.“Chew them,” she said. “They’ll hit your system faster and help counteract thesedative.”Langdon began chewing and instantly cringed. The pills were bitter, clearly meant tobe swallowed whole. Dr. Brooks opened the refrigerator and handed Langdon a half-empty bottle of San Pellegrino. He gratefully took a long drink.The ponytailed doctor now took his right arm and removed the makeshift bandage thatshe’d fashioned out of his jacket, which she laid on the kitchen table. Then she carefullyexamined his wound. As she held his bare arm, Langdon could feel her slender handstrembling“You’ll live,” she announced.Langdon hoped she was going to be okay. He could barely fathom what they’d bothjust endured. “Dr. Brooks,” he said, “we need to call somebody. The consulate … thepolice. Somebody.”She nodded in agreement. “Also, you can stop calling me Dr. Brooks—my name isSienna.”Langdon nodded. “Thanks. I’m Robert.” It seemed the bond they’d just forged fleeingfor their lives warranted a first-name basis. “You said you’re British?”“By birth, yes.”“I don’t hear an accent.”“Good,” she replied. “I worked hard to lose it.”Langdon was about to inquire why, but Sienna motioned for him to follow. She led himdown a narrow corridor to a small, gloomy bathroom. In the mirror above the sink,Langdon glimpsed his reflection for the first time since seeing it in the window of hishospital room.Not good. Langdon’s thick dark hair was matted, and his eyes looked bloodshot andweary. A shroud of stubble obscured his jaw.Sienna turned on the faucet and guided Langdon’s injured forearm under the ice-coldwater. It stung sharply, but he held it there, wincing.Sienna retrieved a fresh washcloth and squirted it with antibacterial soap. “You maywant to look away.”“It’s fine. I’m not bothered by—”Sienna began scrubbing violently, and white-hot pain shot up Langdon’s arm. Heclenched his jaw to prevent himself from shouting out in protest.“You don’t want an infection,” she said, scrubbing harder now. “Besides, if you’re goingto call the authorities, you’ll want to be more alert than you are now. Nothing activatesadrenaline production like pain.”Langdon held on for what felt like a full ten seconds of scrubbing before he forcefullyyanked his arm away. Enough! Admittedly, he felt stronger and more awake; the pain his arm had now entirely overshadowed his headache.“Good,” she said, turning off the water and patting his arm dry with a clean towel.Sienna then applied a small bandage to his forearm, but as she did so, Langdon foundhimself distracted by something he had just noticed—something deeply upsetting to him.For nearly four decades, Langdon had worn an antique collector’s edition Mickey Moustimepiece, a gift from his parents. Mickey’s smiling face and wildly waving arms hadalways served as his daily reminder to smile more often and take life a little lessseriously.“My … watch,” Langdon stammered. “It’s gone!” Without it, he felt suddenlyincomplete. “Was I wearing it when I arrived at the hospital?”Sienna shot him an incredulous look, clearly mystified that he could be worried aboutsuch a trivial thing. “I don’t remember any watch. Just clean yourself up. I’ll be back in afew minutes and we’ll figure out how to get you some help.” She turned to go, butpaused in the doorway, locking eyes with him in the mirror. “And while I’m gone, Isuggest you think very hard about why someone would want to kill you. I imagine it’s thefirst question the authorities will ask.”“Wait, where are you going?”“You can’t talk to the police half naked. I’m going to find you some clothes. Myneighbor is about your size. He’s away, and I’m feeding his cat. He owes me.”With that, Sienna was gone.Robert Langdon turned back to the tiny mirror over the sink and barely recognized theperson staring back at him. Someone wants me dead. In his mind, he again heard therecording of his own delirious mumblings.Very sorry. Very sorry.He probed his memory for some recollection … anything at all. He saw only emptiness.All Langdon knew was that he was in Florence, having suffered a bullet wound to thehead.As Langdon stared into his own weary eyes, he half wondered if he might at anymoment wake up in his reading chair at home, clutching an empty martini glass and acopy of Dead Souls, only to remind himself that Bombay Sapphire and Gogol should never\"\n"

    "passage_2 = \"I’M IN FLORENCE!? Robert Langdon’s head throbbed. He was now seated upright in his hospital bed, repeatedly jamming his finger into the call button. Despite the sedatives in his system, his heart was racing. Dr. Brooks hurried back in, her ponytail bobbing. “Are you okay?” Langdon shook his head in bewilderment. “I’m in Italy!?” “Good,” she said. “You’re remembering.” “No!” Langdon pointed out the window at the commanding edifice in the distance. “I recognize the Palazzo Vecchio.” Dr. Brooks flicked the lights back on, and the Florence skyline disappeared. She came to his bedside, whispering calmly. “Mr. Langdon, there’s no need to worry. You’re suffering from mild amnesia, but Dr. Marconi confirmed that your brain function is fine.” The bearded doctor rushed in as well, apparently hearing the call button. He checked Langdon’s heart monitor as the young doctor spoke to him in rapid, fluent Italian—something about how Langdon was “agitato” to learn he was in Italy. Agitated? Langdon thought angrily. More like stupefied! The adrenaline surging through his system was now doing battle with the sedatives. “What happened to me?” he demanded. “What day is it?!” “Everything is fine,” she said. “It’s early morning. Monday, March eighteenth.” Monday. Langdon forced his aching mind to reel back to the last images he could recall—cold and dark—walking alone across the Harvard campus to a Saturday-night lecture series. That was two days ago?! A sharper panic now gripped him as he tried to recall anything at all from the lecture or afterward. Nothing. The ping of his heart monitor accelerated. The older doctor scratched at his beard and continued adjusting equipment while Dr. Brooks sat again beside Langdon. “You’re going to be okay,” she reassured him, speaking gently. “We’ve diagnosed you with retrograde amnesia, which is very common in head trauma. Your memories of the past few days may be muddled or missing, but you should suffer no permanent damage.” She paused. “Do you remember my first name? I told you when I walked in.” Langdon thought a moment. “Sienna.” Dr. Sienna Brooks. She smiled. “See? You’re already forming new memories.” The pain in Langdon’s head was almost unbearable, and his near-field vision remained blurry. “What happened? How did I get here?” “I think you should rest, and maybe—” “How did I get here?!” he demanded, his heart monitor accelerating further. “Okay, just breathe easy,” Dr. Brooks said, exchanging a nervous look with her colleague. “I’ll tell you.” Her voice turned markedly more serious. “Mr. Langdon, three hours ago, you staggered into our emergency room, bleeding from a head wound, and you immediately collapsed. Nobody had any idea who you were or how you got here. You were mumbling in English, so Dr. Marconi asked me to assist. I’m on sabbatical here from the U.K.” Langdon felt like he had awoken inside a Max Ernst painting. What the hell am I doing in Italy? Normally Langdon came here every other June for an art conference, but this was March. The sedatives pulled harder at him now, and he felt as if earth’s gravity were growing stronger by the second, trying to drag him down through his mattress. Langdon fought it, hoisting his head, trying to stay alert. Dr. Brooks leaned over him, hovering like an angel. “Please, Mr. Langdon,” she whispered. “Head trauma is delicate in the first twenty-four hours. You need to rest, or you could do serious damage.” A voice crackled suddenly on the room’s intercom. “Dr. Marconi?” The bearded doctor touched a button on the wall and replied, “Sì?” The voice on the intercom spoke in rapid Italian. Langdon didn’t catch what it said, but he did catch the two doctors exchanging a look of surprise. Or is it alarm? “Momento,” Marconi replied, ending the conversation. “What’s going on?” Langdon asked. Dr. Brooks’s eyes seemed to narrow a bit. “That was the ICU receptionist. Someone’s here to visit you.” A ray of hope cut through Langdon’s grogginess. “That’s good news! Maybe this person knows what happened to me.” She looked uncertain. “It’s just odd that someone’s here. We didn’t have your name, and you’re not even registered in the system yet.” Langdon battled the sedatives and awkwardly hoisted himself upright in his bed. “If someone knows I’m here, that person must know what happened!” Dr. Brooks glanced at Dr. Marconi, who immediately shook his head and tapped his watch. She turned back to Langdon. “This is the ICU,” she explained. “Nobody is allowed in until nine A.M. at the earliest. In a moment Dr. Marconi will go out and see who the visitor is and what he or she wants.” “What about what I want?” Langdon demanded. Dr. Brooks smiled patiently and lowered her voice, leaning closer. “Mr. Langdon, there are some things you don’t know about last night … about what happened to you. And before you speak to anyone, I think it’s only fair that you have all the facts. Unfortunately, I don’t think you’re strong enough yet to—” “What facts!?” Langdon demanded, struggling to prop himself higher. The IV in his arm pinched, and his body felt like it weighed several hundred pounds. “All I know is I’m in a Florence hospital and I arrived repeating the words ‘very sorry …’ ” A frightening thought now occurred to him. “Was I responsible for a car accident?” Langdon asked. “Did I hurt someone?!” “No, no,” she said. “I don’t believe so.” “Then what?” Langdon insisted, eyeing both doctors furiously. “I have a right to know what’s going on!” There was a long silence, and Dr. Marconi finally gave his attractive young colleague a reluctant nod. Dr. Brooks exhaled and moved closer to his bedside. “Okay, let me tell you what I know … and you’ll listen calmly, agreed?” Langdon nodded, the head movement sending a jolt of pain radiating through his skull. He ignored it, eager for answers. “The first thing is this … Your head wound was not caused by an accident.” “Well, that’s a relief.” “Not really. Your wound, in fact, was caused by a bullet.” Langdon’s heart monitor pinged faster. “I beg your pardon!?” Dr. Brooks spoke steadily but quickly. “A bullet grazed the top of your skull and most likely gave you a concussion. You’re very lucky to be alive. An inch lower, and …” She shook her head. Langdon stared at her in disbelief. Someone shot me? Angry voices erupted in the hall as an argument broke out. It sounded as if whoever had arrived to visit Langdon did not want to wait. Almost immediately, Langdon heard a heavy door at the far end of the hallway burst open. He watched until he saw a figure approaching down the corridor.The woman was dressed entirely in black leather. She was toned and strong with dark, spiked hair. She moved effortlessly, as if her feet weren’t touching the ground, and shewas headed directly for Langdon’s room. Without hesitation, Dr. Marconi stepped into the open doorway to block the visitor’s passage. “Ferma!” the man commanded, holding out his palm like a policeman.The stranger, without breaking stride, produced a silenced handgun. She aimed directly at Dr. Marconi’s chest and fired. There was a staccato hiss. Langdon watched in horror as Dr. Marconi staggered backward into the room, falling to the floor, clutching his chest, his white lab coat drenched in blood.\"\n",

    "passage_3 = \"Snaking through heavy crowds on the Riva degli Schiavoni, Langdon, Sienna, and Ferris hugged the water’s edge, making their way into St. Mark’s Square and arriving at its southernmost border, the edge where the piazza met the sea. Here the throng of tourists was almost impenetrable, creating a claustrophobic crush around Langdon as the multitudes gravitated over to photograph the two massive columns that stood here, framing the square. The official gateway to the city, Langdon thought ironically, knowing the spot had also been used for public executions until as late as the eighteenth century. Atop one of the gateway’s columns, he could see a bizarre statue of St. Theodore, posing proudly with his slain dragon of legendary repute, which always looked to Langdon much more like a crocodile. Atop the second column stood the ubiquitous symbol of Venice—the winged lion. Throughout the city, the winged lion could be seen with his paw resting proudly on an open book bearing the Latin inscription Pax tibi Marce, evangelista meus (May Peace Be with You, Mark, My Evangelist). According to legend, these words were spoken by an angel upon St. Mark’s arrival in Venice, along with the prediction that his body would one day rest here. This apocryphal legend was later used by Venetians to justify plundering St. Mark’s bones from Alexandria for reburial in St. Mark’s Basilica. To this day, the winged lion endures as the city’s symbol and is visible at nearly every turn. Langdon motioned to his right, past the columns, across St. Mark’s Square. “If we get separated, meet at the front door of the basilica.” The others agreed and quickly began skirting the edges of the crowd and following the western wall of the Doge’s Palace into the square. Despite the laws forbidding feeding them, the celebrated pigeons of Venice appeared to be alive and well, some pecking about at the feet of the crowds and others swooping into the outdoor cafés to pillage unprotected bread baskets and torment the tuxedoed waiters. This grand piazza, unlike most in Europe, was shaped not in the form of a square but rather in that of the letter L. The shorter leg—known as the piazzetta—connected the ocean to St. Mark’s Basilica. Up ahead, the square took a ninety-degree left turn into its larger leg, which ran from the basilica toward the Museo Correr. Strangely, rather than being rectilinear, the square was an irregular trapezoid, narrowing substantially at one end. This fun-house-type illusion made the piazza look far longer than it was, an effect that was accentuated by the grid of tiles whose patterns outlined the original stalls of fifteenth-century street merchants. As Langdon continued on toward the elbow of the square, he could see, directly ahead in the distance, the shimmering blue glass dial of the St. Mark’s Clock Tower—the same astronomical clock through which James Bond had thrown a villain in the film Moonraker. It was not until this moment, as he entered the sheltered square, that Langdon could fully appreciate this city’s most unique offering: sound. With virtually no cars or motorized vehicles of any kind, Venice enjoyed a blissful absence of the usual civic traffic, subways, and sirens, leaving sonic space for the distinctly unmechanical tapestry of human voices, cooing pigeons, and lilting violins serenading patrons at the outdoor cafés. Venice sounded like no other metropolitan center in the world. As the late-afternoon sun streamed into St. Mark’s from the west, casting long shadows across the tiled square, Langdon glanced up at the towering spire of the campanile, which rose high over the square and dominated the ancient Venetian skyline. The upper loggia of the tower was packed with hundreds of people. Even the mere thought of being up there made him shiver, and he put his head back down and continued through the sea of humanity. Sienna could easily have kept up with Langdon, but Ferris was lagging behind, and Sienna had decided to split the difference in order to keep both men in sight. Now, however, as the distance between them grew more pronounced, she looked back impatiently. Ferris pointed to his chest, indicating he was winded, and motioned for her to go on ahead. Sienna complied, moving quickly after Langdon and losing sight of Ferris. Yet as she wove her way through the crowd, a nagging feeling held her back—the strange suspicion that Ferris was lagging behind intentionally … as if he were trying to put distance between them. Having learned long ago to trust her instincts, Sienna ducked into an alcove and looked out from the shadows, scanning the crowd behind her and looking for Ferris. Where did he go?! It was as if he were no longer even trying to follow them. Sienna studied the faces in the crowd, and finally she saw him. To her surprise, Ferris had stopped and was crouched low, typing into his phone. The same phone he told me had a dead battery. A visceral fear gripped her, and again she knew she should trust it. He lied to me on the train. As Sienna watched him, she tried to imagine what he was doing. Secretly texting someone? Researching behind her back? Trying to solve the mystery of Zobrist’s poem before Langdon and Sienna could do so? Whatever his rationale, he had blatantly lied to her. I can’t trust him. Sienna wondered if she should storm over and confront him, but she quickly decided to slip back into the crowd before he spotted her. She headed again toward the basilica, searching for Langdon. I’ve got to warn him not to reveal anything else to Ferris. She was only fifty yards from the basilica when she felt a strong hand tugging on her sweater from behind. She spun around and found herself face-to-face with Ferris. The man with the rash was panting heavily, clearly having dashed through the mob to catch up with her. There was a frantic quality about him that Sienna hadn’t seen before. “Sorry,” he said, barely able to breathe. “I got lost in the crowd.” The instant Sienna looked in his eyes, she knew. He’s hiding something. When Langdon arrived in front of St. Mark’s Basilica, he was surprised to discover that his two companions were no longer behind him. Also of surprise to Langdon was the absence of a line of tourists waiting to enter the church. Then again, Langdon realized, this was late afternoon in Venice, the hour when most tourists—their energy flagging from heavy lunches of pasta and wine—decided to stroll the piazzas or sip coffee rather than trying to absorb any more history. Assuming that Sienna and Ferris would be arriving at any moment, Langdon turned his eyes to the entrance of the basilica before him. Sometimes accused of offering “an embarrassing surfeit of ingress,” the building’s lower facade was almost entirely taken up by a phalanx of five recessed entrances whose clustered columns, vaulted archways, and gaping bronze doors arguably made the building, if nothing else, eminently welcoming. One of Europe’s finest specimens of Byzantine architecture, St. Mark’s had a decidedly soft and whimsical appearance. In contrast to the austere gray towers of Notre-Dame or Chartres, St. Mark’s seemed imposing and yet, somehow, far more down-to-earth. Wider than it was tall, the church was topped by five bulging whitewashed domes that exuded an airy, almost festive appearance, causing more than a few of the guidebooks to compare St. Mark’s to a meringue-topped wedding cake. High atop the central peak of the church, a slender statue of St. Mark gazed down into the square that bore his name. His feet rested atop a crested arch that was painted midnight blue and dotted with golden stars. Against this colorful backdrop, the golden winged lion of Venice stood as the shimmering mascot of the city. It was beneath the golden lion, however, that St. Mark’s displayed one of its most famous treasures—four mammoth copper stallions—which at the moment were glinting in the afternoon sun. The Horses of St. Mark’s. Poised as if prepared to leap down at any moment into the square, these four priceless stallions—like so many treasures here in Venice—had been pillaged from Constantinople during the Crusades. Another similarly looted work of art was on display beneath the horses at the southwest corner of the church—a purple porphyry carving known as The Tetrarchs. The statue was well known for its missing foot, broken off while it was being plundered from Constantinople in the thirteenth century. Miraculously, in the 1960s, the foot was unearthed in Istanbul. Venice petitioned for the missing piece of statue, but the Turkish authorities replied with a simple message: You stole the statue—we’re keeping our foot. “Mister, you buy?” a woman’s voice said, drawing Langdon’s gaze downward. A heavyset Gypsy woman was holding up a tall pole on which hung a collection of Venetian masks. Most were in the popular volto intero style—the stylized full-faced, white masks often worn by women during Carnevale. Her collection also contained some playful half-faced Colombina masks, a few triangle-chinned bautas, and a strapless Moretta. Despite her colorful offerings, though, it was a single, grayish-black mask at the top of the pole that seized Langdon’s attention, its menacing dead eyes seeming to stare directly down at him over a long, beaked nose. The plague doctor. Langdon averted his eyes, needing no reminder of what he was doing here in Venice. “You buy?” the Gypsy repeated. Langdon smiled weakly and shook his head. “Sono molto belle, ma no, grazie.” As the woman departed, Langdon’s gaze followed the ominous plague mask as it bobbed above the crowd. He sighed heavily and raised his eyes back to the four copper stallions on the second-floor balcony. In a flash, it hit him. Langdon felt a sudden rush of elements crashing together—Horses of St. Mark’s, Venetian masks, and pillaged treasures from Constantinople. “My God,” he whispered. That’s it!\""

      "bottomless well.\n",
      "A veiled woman.\n",
      "Robert Langdon gazed at her across a river whose churning waters ran red with blood.\n",
      "On the far bank, the woman stood facing him, motionless, solemn, her face hidden by a\n",
      "shroud. In her hand she gripped a blue \n",
      "tainia\n",
      " cloth, which she now raised in honor of the\n",
      "sea of corpses at her feet. The smell of death hung everywhere.\n",
      "Seek\n",
      ", the woman whispered. \n",
      "And ye shall find.\n",
      "Langdon heard the words as if she had spoken them inside his head. “Who are you?”\n",
      "he called out, but his voice made no sound.\n",
      "Time grows short\n",
      ", she whispered. \n",
      "Seek and find.\n",
      "Langdon took a step toward the river, but he could see the waters were bloodred and\n",
      "too deep to traverse. When Langdon raised his eyes again to the veiled woman, the\n",
      "bodies at her feet had multiplied. There were hundreds of them now, maybe thousands,\n",
      "some still alive, writhing in agony, dying unthinkable deaths … consumed by fire, buried\n",
      "in feces, devouring one another. He could hear the mournful cries of human suffering\n",
      "echoing across the water.\n",
      "The woman moved toward him, holding out her slender hands, as if beckoning for help.\n",
      "“Who are you?!” Langdon again shouted.\n",
      "In response, the woman reached up and slowly lifted the veil from her face. She was\n",
      "strikingly beautiful, and yet older than Langdon had imagined—in her sixties perhaps,\n",
      "stately and strong, like a timeless statue. She had a sternly set jaw, deep soulful eyes,\n",
      "and long, silver-gray hair that cascaded over her shoulders in ringlets. An amulet of lapis\n",
      "lazuli hung around her neck—a single snake coiled around a staff.\n",
      "Langdon sensed he knew her … trusted her. \n",
      "But how? Why?\n",
      "She pointed now to a writhing pair of legs, which protruded upside down from the\n",
      "earth, apparently belonging to some poor soul who had \n",
      "been buried headfirst to his\n",
      "waist. The man’s pale thigh bore a single letter—written in mud—\n",
      "R\n",

      "body started vibrating intensely, and then, in a rush of thunder, she exploded into a\n",
      "thousand splintering shards of light.\n",
      "Langdon bolted awake, shouting.\n",
      "The room was bright. He was alone. The sharp smell of medicinal alcohol hung in the\n",
      "air, and somewhere a machine pinged in quiet rhythm with his heart. Langdon tried to\n",
      "move his right arm, but a sharp pain restrained him. He looked down and saw an IV\n",
      "tugging at the skin of his forearm.\n",
      "His pulse quickened, and the machines kept pace, pinging more rapidly.Where am I? What happened?\n",
      "The back of Langdon’s head throbbed, a gnawing pain. Gingerly, he reached up with his\n",
      "free arm and touched his scalp, trying to locate the source of his headache. Beneath his\n",
      "matted hair, he found the hard nubs of a dozen or so stitches caked with dried blood.\n",
      "He closed his eyes, trying to remember an accident.\n",
      "Nothing. A total blank.\n",
      "Think.\n",
      "Only darkness.\n",
      "A man in scrubs hurried in, apparently alerted by Langdon’s racing heart monitor. He\n",
      "had a shaggy beard, bushy mustache, and gentle eyes that radiated a thoughtful calm\n",
      "beneath his overgrown eyebrows.\n",
      "“What … happened?” Langdon managed. “Did I have an accident?”\n",
      "The bearded man put a finger to his lips and then rushed out, calling for someone\n",
      "down the hall.\n",
      "Langdon turned his head, but the movement sent a spike of pain radiating through his\n",
      "skull. He took deep breaths and let the pain pass. Then, very gently and methodically, he\n",
      "surveyed his sterile surroundings.\n",
      "The hospital room had a single bed. No flowers. No cards. Langdon saw his clothes on\n",
      "a nearby counter, folded inside a clear plastic bag. They were covered with blood.\n",
      "My God. It must have been bad.\n",
      "Now Langdon rotated his head very slowly toward the window beside his bed. It was\n",
      "dark outside. Night. All Langdon could see in the glass \n",
      "was his own reflection—an ashen\n",
      "stranger, pale and weary, attached to tubes and wires, surrounded by medical\n",
      "equipment.\n",
      "Voices approached in the hall, and Langdon turned his gaze back toward the room. The\n",
      "doctor returned, now accompanied by a woman.\n",
      "She appeared to be in her early thirties. She wore blue scrubs and had tied her blond\n",
      "hair back in a thick ponytail that swung behind her as she walked.\n",
      "“I’m Dr. Sienna Brooks,” she said, giving Langdon a smile as she entered. “I’ll be\n",
      "working with Dr. Marconi tonight.”\n",
      "Langdon nodded weakly.\n",
      "Tall and lissome, Dr. Brooks moved with the assertive gait of an athlete. Even in\n",
      "shapeless scrubs, she had a willowy elegance about her. Despite the absence of any\n",
      "makeup that Langdon could see, her complexion appeared unusually smooth, the only\n",
      "blemish a tiny beauty mark just above her lips. Her eyes, though a gentle brown, seemed\n",
      "unusually penetrating, as if they had witnessed a profundity of experience rarely\n",
      "encountered by a person her age.\n",
      "“Dr. Marconi doesn’t speak much English,” she said, sitting down beside him, “and he\n",
      "asked me to fill out your admittance form.” She gave him another smile.\n",
      "“Thanks,” Langdon croaked.\n",
      "“Okay,” she began, her tone businesslike. “What is your name?”\n",
      "It took him a moment. “Robert … Langdon.”\n",
      "She shone a penlight in Langdon’s eyes. “Occupation?”This information surfaced even more slowly. “Professor. Art history … and symbology.\n",
      "Harvard University.”\n",
      "Dr. Brooks lowered the light, looking startled. The doctor with the bushy eyebrows\n",
      "looked equally surprised.\n",
      "“You’re … an American?”\n",
      "Langdon gave her a confused look.\n",
      "“It’s just …” She hesitated. “You had no identification when you arrived tonight. You\n",
      "were wearing Harris Tweed and Somerset loafers, so we guessed British.”\n",
      "“I’m American,” Langdon assured her, too exhausted to explain his preference for well-\n",
      "tailored clothing.\n",
      "“Any pain?”\n",
      "“My head,” Langdon replied, his throbbing skull only made worse by the bright penlight.\n",
      "Thankfully, she now pocketed it, taking Langdon’s wrist and checking his pulse.\n",
      "“You woke up shouting,” the woman said. “Do you remember why?”\n",
      "Langdon flashed again on the strange vision of the veiled woman surrounded by\n",
      "writhing bodies. \n",
      "Seek and ye shall find.\n",
      " “I was having a nightmare.”\n",
      "“About?”\n",
      "Langdon told her.\n",
      "Dr. Brooks’s expression remained neutral as she made notes on a clipboard. “Any idea\n",
      "what might have sparked such a frightening vision?”\n",
      "Langdon probed his memory and then shook his head, which pounded in protest.\n",
      "“Okay, Mr. Langdon,” she said, still writing, “a couple of routine questions for you. What\n",
      "day of the week is it?”\n",
      "Langdon thought for a moment. “It’s Saturday. I remember earlier today walking across\n",
      "campus … going to an afternoon lecture series, and then … that’s pretty much the last\n",
      "thing I remember. Did I fall?”\n",
      "“We’ll get to that. Do you know where you are?”\n",
      "Langdon took his best guess. “Massachusetts General Hospital?”\n",
      "Dr. Brooks made another note. “And is there someone we should call for you? Wife?\n",
      "Children?”\n",
      "“Nobody,” Langdon replied instinctively. He had always enjoyed the solitude and\n",
      "independence provided him by his chosen life of bachelorhood, although he had to admit,\n",
      "in his current situation, he’d prefer to have a familiar face at his side. “There are some\n",
      "colleagues I could call, but I’m fine.”\n",
      "Dr. Brooks finished writing, and the older doctor approached. Smoothing back his bushy\n",
      "eyebrows, he produced a small voice recorder from his pocket and showed it to Dr.\n",
      "Brooks. She nodded in understanding and turned back to her patient.\n",
      "“Mr. Langdon, when you arrived tonight, you were mumbling something over and over.”\n",
      "She glanced at Dr. Marconi, who held up the digital recorder and pressed a button.\n",
      "A recording began to play, and Langdon heard his own groggy voice, repeatedly\n",
      "muttering the same phrase: \n",
      "“Ve … sorry. Ve … sorry.”\n",
      "“It sounds to me,” the woman said, “like you’re saying, ‘Very sorry. Very sorry.’ ”\n",
      "Langdon agreed, and yet he had no recollection of it.Dr. Brooks fixed him with a disquietingly intense stare. “Do you have any idea why\n",
      "you’d be saying this? Are you sorry about something?”\n",
      "As Langdon probed the dark recesses of his memory, he again saw the \n",
      "veiled woman.\n",
      "She was standing on the banks of a bloodred river surrounded by bodies. The stench of\n",
      "death returned.\n",
      "Langdon was overcome by a sudden, instinctive sense of danger … not just for himself\n",
      "… but for everyone. The pinging of his heart monitor accelerated rapidly. His muscles\n",
      "tightened, and he tried to sit up.\n",
      "Dr. Brooks quickly placed a firm hand on Langdon’s sternum, forcing him back down.\n",
      "She shot a glance at the bearded doctor, who walked over to a nearby counter and began\n",
      "preparing something.\n",
      "Dr. Brooks hovered over Langdon, whispering now. “Mr. Langdon, anxiety is common\n",
      "with brain injuries, but you need to keep your pulse rate down. No movement. No\n",
      "excitement. Just lie still and rest. You’ll be okay. Your memory will come back slowly.”\n",
      "The doctor returned now with a syringe, which he handed to Dr. Brooks. She injected\n",
      "its contents into Langdon’s IV.\n",
      "“Just a mild sedative to calm you down,” she explained, “and also to help with the\n",
      "pain.” She stood to go. “You’ll be fine, Mr. Langdon. Just sleep. If you need anything,\n",
      "press the button on your bedside.”\n",
      "She turned out the light and departed with the bearded doctor.\n",
      "In the darkness, Langdon felt the drugs washing through his system almost instantly,\n",
      "dragging his body back down into that deep well from which he had emerged. He fought\n",
      "the feeling, forcing his eyes open in the darkness of his room. He tried to sit up, but his\n",
      "body felt like cement.\n",
      "As Langdon shifted, he found himself again facing the window. The lights were out, and\n",
      "in the dark glass, his own reflection had disappeared, replaced by an illuminated skyline\n",
      "in the distance.\n",
      "Amid a contour of spires and domes, a single regal facade dominated Langdon’s field of\n",
      "view. The building was an imposing stone fortress with a notched parapet and a three-\n",
      "hundred-foot tower that swelled near the top, bulging outward into a massive\n",
      "machicolated battlement.\n",
      "Langdon sat bolt upright in bed, pain exploding in his head. He fought off the searing\n",
      "throb and fixed his gaze on the tower.\n",
      "Langdon knew the medieval structure well.\n",
      "It was unique in the world.\n",
      "Unfortunately, it was also located four thousand miles from Massachusetts.\n",
      "Outside his window, hidden in the shadows of the Via Torregalli, a powerfully built\n",
      "woman effortlessly unstraddled her BMW motorcycle and \n",
      "advanced with the intensity of a\n",
      "panther stalking its prey. Her gaze was sharp. Her close-cropped hair—styled into spikes\n",
      "—stood out against the upturned collar of her black leather riding suit. She checked her\n",
      "silenced weapon, and stared up at the window where Robert Langdon’s light had justgone out.\n",
      "Earlier tonight her original mission had gone horribly awry.\n",
      "The coo of a single dove had changed everything.\n",
      "Now she had come to make it right.\n",

      "“How did I get here?!” he demanded, his heart monitor accelerating further.\n",
      "“Okay, just breathe easy,” Dr. Brooks said, exchanging a nervous look with her\n",
      "colleague. “I’ll tell you.” Her voice turned markedly more serious. “Mr. Langdon, three\n",

      "hoisting his head, trying to stay alert.\n",
      "Dr. Brooks leaned over him, hovering like an angel. “Please, Mr. Langdon,” she\n",

      "“Sì?”\n",
      "The voice on the intercom spoke in rapid Italian. Langdon didn’t catch what it said, but\n",
      "he did catch the two doctors exchanging a look of surprise. \n",
      "Or is it alarm?\n",
      "“Momento,”\n",
      " Marconi replied, ending the conversation.\n",
      "“What’s going on?” Langdon asked.\n",

      "before you speak to anyone, I think it’s only fair that you have all the facts.\n",
      "Unfortunately, I don’t think you’re strong enough yet to—”\n",
      "“What facts!?” Langdon demanded, struggling to prop himself higher. The IV in his arm\n",

      "Florence hospital and I arrived repeating the words ‘very sorry …’ ”\n",
      "A frightening thought now occurred to him.\n",
      "“Was I responsible for a car accident?” Langdon asked. “Did I hurt someone?!”\n",
      "“No, no,” she said. “I don’t believe so.”\n",
      "“Then \n",
      "what\n",
      "?” Langdon insisted, eyeing both doctors furiously. “I have a right to know\n",
      "what’s going on!”There was a long silence, and Dr. Marconi finally gave his attractive young colleague a\n",
      "reluctant nod. Dr. Brooks exhaled and moved closer to his bedside. “Okay, let me tell you\n",
      "what I know … and you’ll listen calmly, agreed?”\n",
      "Langdon nodded, the head movement sending a jolt of pain radiating through his skull.\n",
      "He ignored it, eager for answers.\n",
      "“The first thing is this … Your head wound was not caused by an accident.”\n",
      "“Well, that’s a relief.”\n",
      "“Not really. Your wound, in fact, was caused by a bullet.”\n",
      "Langdon’s heart monitor pinged faster. “I beg your pardon!?”\n",
      "Dr. Brooks spoke steadily but quickly. “A bullet grazed the top of your skull and most\n",
      "likely gave you a concussion. You’re very lucky to be alive. An inch lower, and …” She\n",
      "shook her head.\n",
      "Langdon stared at her in disbelief. \n",
      "Someone shot me?\n",
      "Angry voices erupted in the hall as an argument broke out. It sounded \n",
      "as if whoever\n",
      "had arrived to visit Langdon did not want to wait. Almost immediately, Langdon heard a\n",
      "heavy door at the far end of the hallway burst open. He watched until he saw a figure\n",
      "approaching down the corridor.\n",
      "The woman was dressed entirely in black leather. She was toned and strong with dark,\n",
      "spiked hair. She moved effortlessly, as if her feet weren’t touching the ground, and she\n",
      "was headed directly for Langdon’s room.\n",
      "Without hesitation, Dr. Marconi stepped into the open doorway to block the visitor’s\n",
      "passage. \n",
      "“Ferma!”\n",
      " the man commanded, holding out his palm like a policeman.\n",
      "The stranger, without breaking stride, produced a silenced handgun. She aimed directly\n",
      "at Dr. Marconi’s chest and fired.\n",
      "There was a staccato hiss.\n",

      "to one who had made a vast fortune providing a private menu of covert services along\n",
      "the shadowy fringes of society.\n",
      "He had been called many things—a soulless mercenary, a facilitator of sin, the devil’s\n",
      "enabler—but he was none of these. The provost simply provided his clients with the\n",
      "opportunity to pursue their ambitions and \n",
      "desires without consequence; that mankind\n",
      "was sinful in nature was not his problem.\n",

      "threw herself against it and turned the lock.\n",

      "forearm. For an instant, he thought a bullet had passed through the door and hit him, but\n",
      "when he looked down, he realized his IV had snapped off in his arm. The plastic catheter\n",
      "poked out of a jagged hole in his forearm, and warm blood was already flowing backward\n",

      "Langdon was now fully awake.\n",

      "his six-foot frame. He could feel blood dripping down his forearm and pooling in his palm.\n",
      "Bullets continued to slam against the heavy doorknob, and Dr. Brooks pushed Langdon\n",

      "beneath a thirsty-looking houseplant and unlocked a door.\n",
      "The apartment was tiny, the air inside hinting at an ongoing battle between a vanilla-\n",
      "scented candle and old carpeting. The furniture and artwork were meager at best—as if\n",

      "Langdon made a move toward a chair in hopes of sitting down, but Dr. Brooks grabbed\n",
      "his arm with one hand and opened a cabinet with her other. The cabinet was nearly bare\n",
      "… crackers, a few bags of pasta, a can of Coke, and a bottle of NoDoz.\n",
      "She took out the bottle and dumped six caplets into Langdon’s palm. “Caffeine,” she\n",

      "The ponytailed doctor now took his right arm and removed the makeshift bandage that\n",
      "she’d fashioned out of his jacket, which she laid on the kitchen table. Then she carefully\n",

      "trembling.\n",
      "“You’ll live,” she announced.\n",
      "Langdon hoped she was going to be okay. He could barely fathom what they’d both\n",

      "down a narrow corridor to a small, gloomy bathroom. \n",
      "In the mirror above the sink,\n",

      "Not good.\n",
      " Langdon’s thick dark hair was matted, and his eyes looked bloodshot and\n",

      "Sienna turned on the faucet and guided Langdon’s injured forearm under the ice-cold\n",
      "water. It stung sharply, but he held it there, wincing.\n",
      "Sienna retrieved a fresh washcloth and squirted it with antibacterial soap. “You may\n",
      "want to look away.”\n",
      "“It’s fine. I’m not bothered by—”\n",
      "Sienna began scrubbing violently, and white-hot pain shot up Langdon’s arm. He\n",
      "clenched his jaw to prevent himself from shouting out in protest.\n",
      "“You don’t want an infection,” she said, scrubbing harder now. “Besides, if you’re going\n",
      "to call the authorities, you’ll want to be more alert than you are now. Nothing activates\n",
      "adrenaline production like pain.”\n",

      "yanked his arm away. \n",
      "Enough!\n",
      " Admittedly, he felt stronger and more awake; the pain in\n",
      "his arm had now entirely overshadowed his headache.\n",
      "“Good,” she said, turning off the water and patting his arm dry with a clean towel.\n",
      "Sienna then applied a small bandage to his forearm, but as she did so, Langdon found\n",
      "himself distracted by something he had just noticed—something deeply upsetting to him.\n",
      "For nearly four decades, Langdon had worn an antique collector’s edition Mickey Mouse\n",
      "timepiece, a gift from his parents. Mickey’s smiling face and wildly waving arms had\n",
      "always served as his daily reminder to smile more often and take life a little less\n",
      "seriously.\n",
      "“My … watch,” Langdon stammered. “It’s gone!” Without it, he felt suddenly\n",
      "incomplete. “Was I wearing it when I arrived at the hospital?”\n",
      "Sienna shot him an incredulous look, clearly mystified that he could be worried about\n",
      "such a trivial thing. “I don’t remember any watch. Just clean yourself up. I’ll be back in a\n",
      "few minutes and we’ll figure out how to get you some help.” She turned to go, but\n",
      "paused in the doorway, locking eyes with him in the mirror. “And while I’m gone, I\n",

      "THE OBJECT IN\n",
      " Langdon’s hand felt surprisingly heavy for its size. Slender and smooth, the\n",
      "polished metal cylinder was about six inches long and rounded at both ends, like a\n",
      "miniature torpedo.\n",
      "“Before you handle that too roughly,” Sienna offered, “you may want to look at the\n",
      "other side.” She gave him a taut smile. “You say you’re a professor of symbols?”\n",
      "Langdon refocused on the tube, turning it in his hands until a bright red symbol rolled\n",
      "into view, emblazoned on its side.\n",
      "Instantly, his body tensed.\n",
      "As a student of iconography, Langdon knew that precious few images had the power to\n",
      "instill instantaneous fear in the human mind … but the symbol before him definitely made\n",
      "the list. His reaction was visceral and immediate; he placed the tube on the table and slid\n",
      "back his chair.\n",
      "Sienna nodded. “Yeah, that was my reaction, too.”\n",
      "The marking on the tube was a simple trilateral icon.\n",
      "This notorious symbol, Langdon had once read, was developed by Dow Chemical in the\n",
      "1960s to replace an array of impotent warning graphics previously in use. Like all\n",
      "successful symbols, this one was simple, distinctive, and easy to reproduce. Cleverly\n",
      "conjuring associations with everything from crab pincers to ninja hurling knives, the\n",
      "modern “biohazard” symbol had become a global brand that conveyed \n",
      "danger\n",
      " in every\n",
      "language.\n",
      "“This little canister is a biotube,” Sienna said. “Used for transporting dangerous\n",
      "substances. We see these occasionally in the medical field. Inside is a foam sleeve into\n",
      "which you can insert a specimen tube for safe transport. In this case …” She pointed to\n",
      "the biohazard symbol. “I’m guessing a deadly chemical agent … or maybe a … virus?” She\n",
      "paused. \n",
      "“The first Ebola samples were brought back from Africa in a tube similar to this\n",
      "one.”\n",
      "This was not at all what Langdon wanted to hear. “What the hell is it doing in my\n",

      "Violent images of writhing bodies flashed through his mind … and hovering over them,\n",
      "the plague mask.\n",
      "Very sorry … Very sorry.\n",
      "“Wherever this came from,” Sienna said, “this is a very high-end unit. Lead-lined\n",
      "titanium. Virtually impenetrable, even to radiation. I’m guessing government issue.” She\n",
      "pointed to a postage-stamp-size black pad flanking the biohazard symbol. “Thumbprint\n",
      "recognition. Security in case it’s lost or stolen. Tubes like this can be opened only by a\n",
      "specified individual.”Although Langdon sensed his mind now working at normal speed, he still felt as if he\n",

      "I’ve been carrying a biometrically sealed canister.\n",
      "“When I discovered this canister in your jacket, I wanted to show Dr. Marconi privately,\n",
      "but I didn’t have an opportunity before you woke up. I considered trying your thumb on\n",
      "the pad while you were unconscious, but I had no idea what was in the tube, and—”\n",
      "“MY thumb?!” Langdon shook his head. “There’s no way this thing is programmed for\n",
      "me\n",
      " to open it. I don’t know anything about biochemistry. I’d never have anything like\n",
      "this.”\n",

      "Langdon was damned sure. He reached out and placed his thumb on the finger pad.\n",
      "Nothing happened. “See?! I told—”\n",
      "The titanium tube clicked loudly, and Langdon yanked his hand back as if it had been\n",
      "burned. \n",
      "Holy shit.\n",
      " He stared at the canister as if it were about to unscrew itself and start\n",
      "emitting a deadly gas. After three seconds, it clicked again, apparently relocking itself.\n",
      "Speechless, Langdon turned to Sienna.\n",
      "The young doctor exhaled, looking unnerved. “Well, it seems pretty clear that the\n",
      "intended carrier is you.”\n",
      "For Langdon, the entire scenario felt incongruous. “That’s impossible. First of all, how\n",

      "Sienna pursed her lips, mulling over options. “Okay, but as soon as you make that call,\n",

      "Sienna quickly outlined a plan. It was simple, clever, and safe.\n",

      "“I’m an American visiting Florence and I was attacked. My name is Robert Langdon.”\n",
      "“Passport number, please.” The man yawned audibly.\n",

      "The attendant suddenly woke up. “Sir!? Did you say you were \n",

      "The line was already ringing.\n",
      "It rang four times and connected.\n",
      "“This is Collins,” a hoarse voice answered.\n",

      "help. I want to come to the U.S. Consulate immediately. Can you help me?”\n",

      "professional cadence, and yet there was urgency in his voice. “Mr. Langdon, you and I\n",

      "In possession.\n",
      " Langdon sensed the question, while cryptic, could have only one\n",

      "“Well, that was all very MI6,” Sienna said in a half-joking tone. “Are you a spy?”\n",

      "terrible.”\n",
      "She nodded blankly.“And I’m sorry to have dragged you into this. I know your situation at the hospital is\n",

      "Langdon sensed in Sienna’s distant eyes that everything had changed for her this\n",
      "morning. Langdon’s own life was in chaos at the moment, and yet he felt his heart going\n",
      "out to this woman.\n",
      "She saved my life … and I’ve ruined hers.\n",
      "They sat in silence for a full minute, the air between them growing heavy, as if they\n",
      "both wanted to speak, and yet had nothing to say. They were strangers, after all, on a\n",
      "brief and bizarre journey that had just reached a fork in the road, each of them now\n",
      "needing to find separate paths.\n",
      "“Sienna,” Langdon finally said, “when I sort this out with the consulate, if there’s\n",

      "She knew it was probably just the adrenaline, but she found herself strangely attracted\n",
      "to the American professor. In addition to his being \n",
      "handsome, he seemed to possess a\n",
      "sincerely good heart. In some distant, alternate life, Robert Langdon might even be\n",

      "look!”\n",
      "Langdon peered down into the street at the sleek black BMW motorcycle that had just\n",
      "rumbled to a stop in front of Pensione la Fiorentina. The driver was lean and strong,\n",
      "wearing a black leather suit and helmet. As the driver gracefully swung off the bike and\n",
      "removed a polished black helmet, Sienna could hear Langdon stop breathing.\n",
      "The woman’s spiked hair was unmistakable.\n",
      "She produced a familiar handgun, checked the silencer, and slid it back inside her\n",
      "jacket pocket. Then, moving with lethal grace, she slipped inside the hotel.\n",
      "“Robert,” Sienna whispered, her voice taut with fear. “The U.S. government just sent\n",

      "the hotel across the street. The spike-haired woman had just entered, but Langdon could\n",
      "not fathom how she had gotten the address.\n",
      "Adrenaline coursed through his system, disjointing his thought process once again. “My\n",
      "own government sent someone to kill me?”\n",
      "Sienna looked equally astounded. “Robert, that means the original attempt on your life\n",
      "at the hospital also was sanctioned by your government.” She got up and double-checked\n",
      "the lock on the apartment door. “If the U.S. Consulate has permission to kill you …” She\n",
      "didn’t finish the thought, but she didn’t have to. The implications were terrifying.\n",
      "What the hell do they think I did? Why is my own government hunting me?!\n",
      "Once again, Langdon heard the two words he had apparently been mumbling when he\n",
      "staggered into the hospital.\n",
      "Very sorry … very sorry.\n",
      "“You’re not safe here,” Sienna said. “\n",
      "We’re\n",
      " not safe here.” She motioned across the\n",
      "street. “That woman saw us flee the hospital together, and I’m betting your government\n",
      "and the police are already trying to track me down. My apartment is a sublet in someone\n",
      "else’s name, but they’ll find me eventually.” She turned her attention to the biotube on\n",
      "the table. “You need to open that, right now.”\n",
      "Langdon eyed the titanium device, seeing only the biohazard symbol.\n",
      "“Whatever’s inside that tube,” Sienna said, “probably has an ID code, an agency\n",

      "something\n",
      ". You need information. I need information! Your\n",
      "government killed my friend!”\n",
      "The pain in Sienna’s voice shook Langdon from his thoughts, and he nodded, knowing\n",
      "she was correct. “Yes, I’m … very sorry.” Langdon cringed, hearing those words again. He\n",
      "turned to the canister on the table, wondering what answers might be hidden inside. “It\n",
      "could be incredibly dangerous to open this.”\n",
      "Sienna thought for a moment. “Whatever’s inside will be exceptionally well contained,\n",
      "probably in a shatterproof Plexiglas test tube. This biotube is just an outer shell to\n",
      "provide additional security during transport.”\n",
      "Langdon looked out the window at the black motorcycle parked in front of the hotel.\n",
      "The woman had not yet come out, but she would soon figure out that Langdon was not\n",
      "there. He wondered what her next move would be … and how long it would take before\n",
      "she was pounding on the apartment door.\n",
      "Langdon made up his mind. He lifted the titanium tube and reluctantly placed his\n",
      "thumb on the biometric pad. After a moment the canister pinged and then clicked loudly.\n",
      "Before the tube could lock itself again, Langdon twisted the two halves against each\n",
      "other in opposite directions. After a quarter turn, the canister pinged a second time, and\n",
      "Langdon knew he was committed.\n",
      "Langdon’s hands felt sweaty as he continued unscrewing the tube. The two halvesturned smoothly on perfectly machined threads. He kept twisting, feeling as if he were\n",
      "about to open a precious Russian nesting doll, except that he had no idea what might fall\n",
      "out.\n",
      "After five turns, the two halves released. With a deep breath, Langdon gently pulled\n",
      "them apart. The gap between the halves widened, and a foam-rubber interior slid out.\n",
      "Langdon laid it on the table. The protective padding vaguely resembled an elongated\n",
      "Nerf football.\n",
      "Here goes nothing.\n",
      "Langdon gently folded back the top of the protective foam, finally revealing the object\n",
      "nestled inside.\n",
      "Sienna stared down at the contents and cocked her head, looking puzzled. “Definitely\n",
      "not what I expected.”\n",
      "Langdon had anticipated some kind of futuristic-looking vial, but the content of the\n",
      "biotube was anything but modern. The ornately carved object appeared to be made of\n",
      "ivory and was approximately the size of a roll of Life Savers.\n",
      "“It looks old,” Sienna whispered. “Some kind of …”\n",
      "“Cylinder seal,” Langdon told her, finally permitting himself to exhale.\n",
      "Invented by the Sumerians in 3500 B.C., cylinder seals were the precursors to the\n",
      "intaglio form of printmaking. Carved with decorative images, a seal contained a hollow\n",
      "shaft, through which an axle pin was inserted so the carved drum could be rolled like a\n",
      "modern paint roller across wet clay or terra-cotta to “imprint” a recurring band of\n",
      "symbols, images, or text.\n",
      "This particular seal, Langdon guessed, was undoubtedly quite rare and valuable, and\n",
      "yet he still couldn’t imagine why it would be locked in a titanium canister like some kind\n",
      "of bioweapon.\n",
      "As Langdon delicately turned the seal in his fingers, he realized that this one bore an\n",
      "especially gruesome carving—a three-headed, horned Satan who was in the process of\n",
      "eating three different men at once, one man in each of his three mouths.\n",
      "Pleasant.\n",
      "Langdon’s eyes moved to seven letters carved beneath the devil. The ornate\n",
      "calligraphy was written in mirror image, as was all text on imprinting rollers, but Langdon\n",
      "had no trouble reading the letters—\n",

      "Without hesitation, four soldiers dashed toward the entrance of the apartment building.\n",

      "they found us!”\n",
      "Down in the street, Agent Christoph Brüder shouted orders to his men as they rushed into\n",
      "the building. He was a powerfully built man whose military background had imbued himwith an emotionless sense of duty and respect for the command chain. He knew his\n",
      "mission, and he knew the stakes.\n",
      "The organization for whom he worked contained many divisions, but Brüder’s division—\n",
      "Surveillance and Response Support—was summoned only when a situation reached\n",
      "“crisis” status.\n",
      "As his men disappeared into the apartment building, Brüder stood watch at the front\n",

      "“It’s Brüder,” he said. “We’ve successfully tracked Langdon through his computer IP\n",

      "What the hell are THEY doing here?!\n",
      "She ran a hand through her spiked hair, suddenly grasping the dire consequences of\n",

      "If the SRS team is here, then it’s all over for me.\n",

      "apartment building across the street!”\n",
      "She awaited a response, but when it came, she heard only sharp clicks on the line,\n",
      "then an electronic voice, which calmly stated, “Disavowal protocol commencing.”\n",
      "Vayentha lowered the phone and looked at the screen just in time to see the comm\n",

      "As the blood drained from her face, Vayentha forced herself to accept what was\n",

      "Brooks had managed the morning’s substantial stress with a kind of detached poise, but\n",
      "now her calm demeanor had grown taut with an emotion Langdon had yet to see in her—\n",
      "true fear.\n",
      "In the hallway, Sienna ran ahead, rushing past the elevator, which was already\n",
      "descending, no doubt summoned by the men now entering the lobby. She sprinted to the\n",
      "end of the hall and, without looking back, disappeared into the stairwell.\n",
      "Langdon followed close behind, skidding on the smooth soles of his borrowed loafers.\n",
      "The tiny projector in the breast pocket of his Brioni suit bounced against his chest as he\n",

      "listening intently. Langdon could hear footsteps pounding up the stairs from below.\n",
      "“Is there another exit?” Langdon whispered.\n",
      "“Follow me,” she said tersely.\n",
      "Sienna had kept Langdon alive once already today, and so, with little choice but to\n",
      "trust the woman, Langdon took a deep breath and bounded down the stairs after her.\n",
      "They descended one floor, and the sounds of approaching boots grew very close now,\n",
      "echoing only a floor or two below them.\n",
      "Why is she running directly into them?\n",
      "Before Langdon could protest, Sienna grabbed his hand and yanked \n",
      "him out of the\n",
      "stairwell along a deserted hallway of apartments—a long corridor of locked doors.\n",
      "There’s nowhere to hide!\n",
      "Sienna flipped a light switch and a few bulbs went out, but the dim hallway did little to\n",
      "hide them. Sienna and Langdon were clearly visible here. The thundering footsteps were\n",
      "nearly upon them now, and Langdon knew their assailants would appear on the staircase\n",
      "at any moment, with a direct view down this hall.\n",
      "“I need your jacket,” Sienna whispered as she yanked Langdon’s suit jacket off him.\n",
      "She then forced Langdon to crouch on his haunches behind her in a recessed doorframe.\n",

      "What is she doing? She’s in plain sight!\n",

      "Sienna kept yelling at them. \n",
      "“Tanto chiasso a quest’ora!” So much noise at this hour!\n",
      "Langdon now saw that Sienna had draped his black jacket over her head and shoulders\n",
      "like an old woman’s shawl. She had hunched over, positioning herself to obstruct their\n",
      "view of Langdon crouched in the shadows, and now, utterly transformed, she hobbled one\n",
      "step toward them and screamed like a senile old woman.\n",
      "One of the soldiers held up his hand, motioning for her to return to her apartment.\n",
      "“Signora! Rientri subito in casa!”\n",
      "Sienna took another rickety step, shaking her fist angrily. \n",
      "“Avete svegliato mio marito,\n",
      "che è malato!”\n",
      "Langdon listened in bewilderment. \n",
      "They woke up your ailing husband?\n",
      "The other soldier now raised his machine gun and aimed directly at her. \n",
      "“Ferma o\n",

      "but impressive.\n",
      " Apparently a\n",
      "background in drama could be a versatile weapon.\n",
      "Sienna removed the jacket from her head and tossed it back to Langdon. “Okay, follow\n",
      "me.”\n",
      "This time Langdon followed without hesitation.\n",
      "They descended to the landing above the lobby, where two more soldiers \n",
      "were just\n",
      "entering the elevator to go upstairs. On the street outside, another soldier stood watch\n",
      "beside the van, his black uniform stretched taut across his muscular body. In silence,\n",
      "Sienna and Langdon hurried downstairs toward the basement.\n",
      "The underground carport was dark and smelled of urine. Sienna jogged over to a corner\n",
      "packed with scooters and motorcycles. She stopped at a silver Trike—a three-wheeled\n",
      "moped contraption that looked like the ungainly offspring of an Italian Vespa and an adult\n",
      "tricycle. She ran her slender hand beneath the Trike’s front fender and removed a small\n",
      "magnetized case. Inside was a key, which she inserted, and revved the engine.\n",
      "Seconds later, Langdon was seated behind her on the bike. Precariously perched on the\n",
      "small seat, Langdon groped at his sides, looking for handgrips or something to steady\n",
      "himself.\n",
      "“Not the moment for modesty,” Sienna said, grabbing his hands and wrapping them\n",
      "around her slender waist. “You’ll want to hold on.”\n",
      "Langdon did exactly that as Sienna gunned the Trike up the exit ramp. The vehicle had\n",
      "more power than he would have imagined, and they nearly left the ground as they\n",
      "launched out of the garage, emerging into the early-morning light about fifty yards from\n",
      "the main entrance. The brawny soldier in front of the building turned at once to see\n",
      "Langdon and Sienna tearing away, their Trike letting out a high-pitched whine as she\n",
      "opened the throttle.\n",
      "Perched on the back, Langdon peered back over his shoulder toward the soldier, who\n",
      "now raised his weapon and took careful aim. Langdon braced himself. A single shot rangout, ricocheting off the Trike’s back fender, barely missing the base of Langdon’s spine.\n",
      "Jesus!\n",
      "Sienna made a hard left at an intersection, and Langdon felt himself sliding, fighting to\n",
      "keep his balance.\n",
      "“Lean toward me!” she shouted.\n",
      "Langdon leaned forward, centering himself again as Sienna raced the Trike down a\n",
      "larger thoroughfare. They had driven a full block before Langdon began breathing again.\n",
      "Who the hell were those men?!\n",
      "Sienna’s focus remained locked on the road ahead as she raced down the avenue,\n",
      "weaving in and out of the light morning traffic. Several pedestrians did double takes as\n",
      "they passed, apparently puzzled to see a six-foot man in a Brioni suit riding \n",
      "behind\n",
      " a\n",
      "slender woman.\n",
      "Langdon and Sienna had traveled three blocks and were approaching a major\n",
      "intersection when horns blared up ahead. A sleek black van \n",
      "rounded the corner on two\n",
      "wheels, fishtailing into the intersection, and then accelerating up the road directly toward\n",
      "them. The van was identical to the soldiers’ van back at the apartment building.\n",
      "Sienna immediately swerved hard to her right and slammed on the brakes. Langdon’s\n",
      "chest pressed hard into her back as she skidded to a stop out of sight behind a parked\n",
      "delivery truck. She nestled the Trike up to the rear bumper of the truck and killed the\n",
      "engine.\n",
      "Did they see us!?\n",
      "She and Langdon huddled low and waited … breathless.\n",
      "The van roared past without hesitation, apparently never having seen them. As the\n",
      "vehicle sped by, however, Langdon caught a fleeting glimpse of someone inside.\n",
      "In the backseat, an attractive older woman was wedged between two soldiers like a\n",
      "captive. Her eyes sagged and her head bobbed as if she were delirious or maybe\n",
      "drugged. She wore an amulet and had long silver hair that fell in ringlets.\n",
      "For a moment Langdon’s throat clenched, and he thought he’d seen a ghost.\n",
      "It was the woman from his visions.\n",

      "THE PROVOST STORMED\n",
      " out of the control room and marched along the long starboard deck of\n",
      "The Mendacium\n",
      ", trying to gather his thoughts. What had just transpired at the Florence\n",
      "apartment building was unthinkable.\n",
      "He circled the entire ship twice before stalking into his office and taking out a bottle of\n",
      "fifty-year-old Highland Park single malt. Without pouring a glass, he set down the bottle\n",
      "and turned his back on it—a personal reminder that he was still very much in control.\n",
      "His eyes moved instinctively to a heavy, weathered tome on his bookshelf—a gift from\n",
      "a client … the client whom he now wished he’d never met.\n",
      "A year ago … how could I have known?\n",
      "The provost did not normally interview prospective clients personally, but this one had\n",
      "come to him through a trusted source, and so he had made an exception.\n",
      "It had been a dead calm day at sea when the client arrived aboard \n",
      "The Mendacium\n",
      " via\n",
      "his own private helicopter. The visitor, a notable figure in his field, was forty-six, clean-\n",
      "cut, and exceptionally tall, with piercing green eyes.\n",
      "“As you know,” the man had begun, “your services were recommended to me by a\n",
      "mutual friend.” The visitor stretched out his long legs and made himself at home in the\n",
      "provost’s lushly appointed office. “So, let me tell you what I need.”\n",
      "“Actually, no,” the provost interrupted, showing the man who was in charge. “My\n",
      "protocol requires that you tell me nothing. I will explain the services I provide, and you\n",
      "will decide which, if any, are of interest to you.”\n",
      "The visitor looked taken aback but acquiesced and listened intently. In the end, what\n",
      "the lanky newcomer desired had turned out to be very standard fare for the Consortium—\n",
      "essentially a chance to become “invisible” for a while so he could pursue an endeavor far\n",
      "from prying eyes.\n",
      "Child’s play.\n",
      "The Consortium would accomplish this by providing him a fake identity and a secure\n",
      "location, entirely off the grid, where he could do his work in total secrecy—whatever his\n",
      "work might be. The Consortium never inquired for what \n",
      "purpose\n",
      " a client required a\n",
      "service, preferring to know as little as possible about those for whom they worked.\n",
      "For a full year, at a staggering profit, the provost had provided safe haven to the\n",
      "green-eyed man, who had turned out to be an ideal client. The provost had no contact\n",
      "with him, and all of his bills were paid on time.\n",
      "Then, two weeks ago, everything changed.\n",
      "Unexpectedly, the client had made contact, demanding a personal meeting with the\n",
      "provost. Considering the sum of money the client had paid, the provost obliged.\n",
      "The disheveled man who arrived on the yacht was barely recognizable as the steady,\n",
      "clean-cut person with whom the provost had done business the year before. He had a\n",
      "wild look in his once-sharp green eyes. He looked almost … ill.\n",
      "What happened to him? What has he been doing?The provost had ushered the jittery man into his office.\n",

      "haired woman. “Yes,” the provost said, “your silver-haired devil. We are well aware of\n",
      "your enemies. And as powerful as she may be, for a full year we’ve kept her from you,\n",
      "and we will continue to do so.”\n",

      "“Don’t let her beauty fool you, she is a dangerous foe.”\n",
      "True\n",
      ", the provost thought, still displeased that his client had drawn the attention of\n",
      "someone so influential. The silver-haired woman had tremendous access and resources—\n",
      "not the kind of adversary the provost appreciated having to deflect.\n",
      "“If she or her demons locate me …” the client began.\n",
      "“They won’t,” the provost had assured him. “Have we not thus far hidden you and\n",
      "provided you everything you’ve requested?”\n",
      "“Yes,” the man said. “And yet, I will sleep easier if …” He paused, regrouping. “I need\n",

      "“Those wishes being?”\n",
      "The man reached into a bag and pulled out a small, sealed envelope. “The contents of\n",
      "this envelope provide access to a safe-deposit box in Florence. Inside the box, you will\n",
      "find a small object. If anything happens to me, I need you to deliver the object for me. It\n",
      "is a gift of sorts.”\n",
      "“Very well.” The provost lifted his pen to make notes. “And to whom shall I deliver it?”\n",
      "“To the silver-haired devil.”\n",
      "The provost glanced up. “A gift for your tormentor?”\n",
      "“More of a thorn in her side.” His eyes flashed wildly. “A clever little barb fashioned\n",
      "from a bone. She will discover it is a map … her own personal Virgil … an escort to the\n",
      "center of her own private hell.”\n",
      "The provost studied him for a long moment. “As you wish. Consider it done.”\n",
      "“The timing will be critical,” the man urged. “The gift should not be delivered too soon.\n",
      "You must keep it hidden until …” He paused, suddenly lost in thought.\n",
      "“Until when?” the provost prodded.\n",
      "The man stood abruptly and walked over behind the provost’s desk, grabbing a red\n",
      "marker and frantically circling a date on the provost’s personal desk calendar. “Until this\n",
      "day.”\n",
      "The provost set his jaw and exhaled, swallowing his displeasure at the man’s\n",
      "brazenness. “Understood,” the provost said. “I will do nothing until the circled day, at\n",
      "which time the object in the safe-deposit box, whatever it may be, will be delivered to\n",
      "the silver-haired woman. You have my word.” He counted the days on his calendar until\n",
      "the awkwardly circled date. “I will carry out your wishes in precisely fourteen days from\n",
      "now.”\n",
      "“And not one day before!” the client admonished feverishly.\n",
      "“I understand,” the provost assured. “Not a day before.”\n",
      "The provost took the envelope, slid it into the man’s file, and made the necessarynotations to ensure that his client’s wishes were followed precisely. While his client had\n",
      "not described the exact nature of the object in the safe-deposit box, the provost preferred\n",
      "it this way. Detachment was a cornerstone of the Consortium’s philosophy. \n",
      "Provide the\n",
      "service. Ask no questions. Pass no judgment.\n",
      "The client’s shoulders softened and he exhaled heavily. “Thank you.”\n",
      "“Anything else?” the provost had asked, eager to rid himself of his transformed client.\n",
      "“Yes, actually, there is.” He reached into his pocket and produced a small, crimson\n",
      "memory stick. “This is a video file.” He laid the memory \n",
      "stick in front of the provost. “I\n",
      "would like it uploaded to the world media.”\n",
      "The provost studied the man curiously. The Consortium often mass-distributed\n",
      "information for clients, and yet something about this man’s request felt disconcerting. “On\n",
      "the same date?” the provost asked, motioning at the scrawled circle on his calendar.\n",
      "“Same exact date,” the client replied. “Not one moment before.”\n",
      "“Understood.” The provost tagged the red memory stick with the proper information.\n",
      "“So that’s it, then?” He stood up, attempting to end the meeting.\n",
      "His client remained seated. “No. There is one final thing.”\n",
      "The provost sat back down.\n",
      "The client’s green eyes were looking almost feral now. “Shortly after you deliver this\n",
      "video, I will become a very famous man.”\n",
      "You are already a famous man\n",
      ", the provost had thought, considering his client’s\n",
      "impressive accomplishments.\n",
      "“And you will deserve some of the credit,” the man said. “The service you have\n",
      "provided has enabled me to create my masterpiece … an opus that is going to change the\n",
      "world. You should be proud of your role.”\n",
      "“Whatever your masterpiece is,” the provost said with growing impatience, “I’m\n",
      "pleased you have had the privacy required to create it.”\n",
      "“As a show of thanks, I’ve brought you a parting gift.” The unkempt man reached into\n",
      "his bag. “A book.”\n",
      "The provost wondered if perhaps this book was the secret opus the client had been\n",
      "working on for all this time. “And did you write this book?”\n",
      "“No.” The man heaved a massive tome up onto the table. “Quite to the contrary … this\n",
      "book was written \n",
      "for\n",
      " me.”\n",
      "Puzzled, the provost eyed the edition his client had produced. \n",
      "He thinks this was\n",
      "written for him?\n",
      " The volume was a literary classic … written in the fourteenth century.\n",
      "“Read it,” the client urged with an eerie smile. “It will help you understand all I have\n",
      "done.”\n",
      "With that, the unkempt visitor had stood up, said good-bye, and abruptly departed. The\n",
      "provost watched through his office window as the man’s helicopter lifted off the deck and\n",
      "headed back toward the coast of Italy.\n",
      "Then the provost returned his attention to the large book before him. With uncertain\n",
      "fingers, he lifted the leather cover and thumbed to the \n",
      "beginning. The opening stanza of\n",
      "the work was written in large calligraphy, taking up the entire first page.INFERNO\n",
      "Midway upon the journey of our life\n",
      "I found myself within a forest dark,\n",
      "for the straightforward pathway had been lost.\n",
      "On the opposing page, his client had signed the book with a handwritten message:\n",
      "My dear friend, thank you for helping me find the path.\n",
      "The world thanks you, too.\n",
      "The provost had no idea what this meant, but he’d read enough. He closed the book\n",
      "and placed it on his bookshelf. Thankfully, his professional relationship with this strange\n",
      "individual would be over soon. \n",
      "Fourteen more days\n",
      ", the provost thought, turning his gaze\n",
      "to the wildly scrawled red circle on his personal calendar.\n",
      "In the days that followed, the provost felt uncharacteristically on edge about this client.\n",
      "The man seemed to have come unhinged. Nonetheless, despite the provost’s intuition,\n",
      "the time passed without incident.\n",
      "Then, just before the circled date, there occurred a rapid series of calamitous events in\n",
      "Florence. The provost tried to handle the crisis, but it quickly accelerated out of control.\n",
      "The crisis climaxed with his client’s breathless ascent up the Badia tower.\n",
      "He jumped off … to his death.\n",
      "Despite his horror at losing a client, especially in this manner, the provost remained a\n",
      "man of his word. He quickly began preparing to make good on his final promise to the\n",
      "deceased—the delivery to the silver-haired woman of the contents of a safe-deposit box\n",
      "in Florence—the timing of which, he had been admonished, was critical.\n",
      "Not before the date circled in your calendar.\n",
      "The provost gave the envelope containing the safe-deposit-box codes to Vayentha,\n",
      "who had traveled to Florence to recover the object inside—this “clever little barb.” When\n",
      "Vayentha called in, however, her news was both startling and deeply alarming. The\n",
      "contents of the safe-deposit box had already been removed, and Vayentha had barely\n",
      "escaped being detained. Somehow, the silver-haired woman had learned of the account\n",
      "and had used her influence to gain access to the safe-deposit box and also to place an\n",

      "religion, history, politics, philosophy, and social commentary in a tapestry of fiction that,\n",
      "while erudite, remained wholly accessible to the masses. The work became such a pillar\n",

      "through deep arched tunnels in the colossal fortification.\n",

      "Leave it to the Italians.\n",
      "Most American Porta-Potties were covered with sophomoric cartoons that vaguely\n",
      "resembled huge breasts or penises. The graffiti on this one, however, looked more like an\n",

      "apparently reading his mind. “The Florence Art Institute is on the other side of this stone\n",

      "As if to confirm Sienna’s statement, a group of students appeared in the distance,\n",
      "ambling toward them with art portfolios under their arms. They were chatting, lighting\n",
      "cigarettes, and puzzling over the roadblock in front of them at the Porta Romana.\n",
      "Langdon and Sienna crouched lower to stay out of sight of the students, and as they\n",
      "did so, Langdon was struck, most unexpectedly, by a curious thought.\n",
      "The half-buried sinners with their legs in the air.\n",
      "Perhaps it was on account of the smell of human waste, or possibly the recumbent\n",
      "bicyclist with bare legs flailing in front of him, but whatever the stimulus, Langdon had\n",
      "flashed on the putrid world of the Malebolge and the naked legs protruding upside down\n",
      "from the earth.\n",
      "He turned suddenly to his companion. “Sienna, in our version of \n",

      "punished the fraudulent—those guilty of deliberate evil.”\n",
      "Langdon advanced slides to show a detail of the Malebolge and then took the audience\n",
      "down through the ditches one by one. “From top to bottom we have: the seducers\n",

      "half buried upside down with their legs in the air … the sorcerers with their heads twisted\n",

      "La Mappa\n",

      "The Medici.\n",

      "They were standing in a glade of moss and ferns on the edge of a small forest. From\n",
      "here, the Palazzo Pitti was entirely obscured from view, and Langdon sensed they were\n",
      "about as far from the palace as one could get in the gardens. At least there were no\n",
      "workers or tourists out this far at this early hour.\n",
      "Langdon gazed at a peastone pathway that wound gracefully downhill into the forest\n",
      "before them. At the point where the path disappeared into the trees, a marble statue had\n",
      "been perfectly situated to receive the eye. Langdon was not surprised. The Boboli\n",
      "Gardens had enjoyed the exceptional design talents of Niccolò Tribolo, Giorgio Vasari,\n",
      "and Bernardo Buontalenti—a brain trust of aesthetic talent that had created on this 111-\n",

      "landscape architecture—where there were some faux-bois benches and a small fountain.\n",

      "Langdon took the projector from his pocket and began shaking it. “Sienna, whoever\n",
      "created this digital image not only added letters to the sinners in the Malebolge, but he\n",
      "also changed the order of the sins.” He hopped up on the bench, towering over Sienna,\n",

      "Sienna found them on the projection and read from top to bottom. “Catrovacer.”\n",

      "“Easier than that, actually. If these levels were a deck of ten cards, the deck was not so\n",
      "much shuffled as simply cut once. After the cut, the cards remain in the correct order, but\n",

      "action that left her baffled—a familiar black van around which several black-clad agents\n",
      "were calling out orders to the local authorities.\n",
      "These men, without a doubt, were members of the SRS team, and yet Vayentha could\n",

      "“Vasari,” Sienna stammered, taking a full step backward on the path. “The artist who\n",
      "hid the words \n",
      "cerca trova\n",
      " in his mural.”\n",
      "Langdon couldn’t help but smile. \n",
      "Vasari. Vasari.\n",
      " In addition to shedding a ray of light on\n",
      "his strange predicament, this revelation also meant Langdon was no longer wondering\n",
      "what terrible thing he might have done … for which he had been profusely saying he was\n",
      "very sorry.\n",
      "“Robert, you clearly had seen this Botticelli image on the projector before you were\n",
      "injured, and you knew it contained a code that pointed to Vasari’s mural. That’s why you\n",
      "woke up and kept repeating Vasari’s name!”\n",
      "Langdon tried to calculate what all of this meant. Giorgio Vasari—a sixteenth-century\n",
      "artist, architect, and writer—was a man Langdon often referred to as “the world’s first art\n",
      "historian.” Despite the hundreds of paintings Vasari created, and the dozens of buildings\n",
      "he designed, his most enduring legacy was his seminal book, \n",
      "Lives of the Most Excellent\n",
      "Painters, Sculptors, and Architects\n",
      ", a collection of biographies of Italian artists, which to\n",
      "this day remains requisite reading for students of art history.\n",
      "The words \n",
      "cerca trova\n",
      " had placed Vasari back in the mainstream consciousness about\n",
      "thirty years ago when his “secret message” was discovered high on his sprawling mural in\n",
      "the Palazzo Vecchio’s Hall of the Five Hundred. The tiny letters appeared on a green\n",
      "battle flag, barely visible among the chaos of the war scene. While consensus had yet to\n",
      "be reached as to why Vasari added this strange message to his mural, the leading theory\n",
      "was that it was a clue to future generations of the existence of a lost Leonardo da Vinci\n",
      "fresco hidden in a three-centimeter gap behind that wall.\n",
      "Sienna was glancing nervously up through the trees. “There’s still one thing I don’t\n",

      "Langdon had been wondering the same thing.\n",
      "The distant buzz of the surveillance drone was getting louder again, and Langdon knew\n",
      "the time had come for a decision. He failed to see how Vasari’s \n",
      "Battaglia di Marciano\n",
      "could possibly relate to Dante’s \n",
      "Inferno\n",

      "Again Langdon saw the silver-haired woman calling out to him from across the river.\n",
      "Time is running out!\n",
      " If there were answers, Langdon sensed, they would be at the\n",
      "Palazzo Vecchio.\n",
      "He now flashed on an old adage from early Grecian free divers who hunted lobsters in\n",
      "the coral caves of the Aegean Islands. \n",
      "When swimming into a dark tunnel, there arrives a\n",
      "point of no return when you no longer have enough breath to double back. Your onlychoice is to swim forward into the unknown … and pray for an exit.\n",
      "Langdon wondered if they had reached that point.\n",
      "He eyed the maze of garden pathways before them. If he and Sienna could reach the\n",
      "Pitti Palace and exit the gardens, then the old city was just a short walk across the most\n",
      "famous footbridge in the world—the Ponte Vecchio. It was always crowded and would\n",
      "provide good cover. From there, the Palazzo Vecchio was only a few blocks away.\n",
      "The drone hummed closer now, and Langdon felt momentarily overwhelmed by\n",
      "exhaustion. The realization that he had not been saying “very sorry” left him feeling\n",
      "conflicted about running from the police.\n",
      "“Eventually, they’re going to catch me, Sienna,” Langdon said. “It might be better for\n",

      "shooting at you! You need to figure out what you’re involved in. You need to look at that\n",
      "Vasari mural and hope it jars your memory. Maybe it will help you learn where this\n",
      "projector came from and why you’re carrying it.”\n",
      "Langdon pictured the spike-haired woman coldly killing Dr. Marconi … the soldiers firing\n",
      "on them … the Italian military police gathering in the Porta Romana … and now a\n",
      "surveillance drone tracking them through the Boboli Gardens. He fell silent, rubbing his\n",
      "tired eyes as he considered his options.\n",
      "“Robert?” Sienna’s voice rose. “There’s one other thing … something that didn’t seem\n",

      "“I intended to tell you at the apartment,” she said, “but …”\n",
      "“What is it?”\n",
      "Sienna pursed her lips, looking uncomfortable. “When you arrived at the hospital, you\n",
      "were delirious and trying to communicate.”\n",
      "“Yes,” Langdon said, “mumbling ‘Vasari, Vasari.’ ”\n",
      "“Yes, but \n",
      "before\n",
      " that … before we got out the recorder, in the first moments after you\n",

      "now I’m not so sure.”\n",
      "If I fail, then all is death?\n",
      " The words hit Langdon hard. The haunting images of death\n",
      "flickered before him … Dante’s inferno, the biohazard symbol, the plague doctor. Yet\n",
      "again, the face of the beautiful silver-haired woman pleaded with him across the bloodred\n",
      "river. \n",
      "Seek and find! Time is running out!\n",
      "Sienna’s voice pulled him back. “Whatever this projector ultimately points to … or\n",
      "whatever you’re trying to find, it must be something extremely dangerous. The fact that\n",
      "people are trying to kill us …” Her voice cracked slightly, and she took a moment toregroup. “Think about it. They just shot at you in broad daylight … shot at \n",
      "me\n",
      "—an\n",
      "innocent bystander. Nobody seems to be looking to negotiate. Your own government\n",
      "turned on you … you called them for help, and they sent someone to kill you.”\n",

      "Langdon’s location with the assassin, or whether the consulate itself had sent the\n",
      "assassin, was irrelevant. The upshot was the same. \n",
      "My own government is not on my\n",
      "side.\n",

      " “I wish I knew what we were looking for. That would help put all of this\n",
      "into perspective.”\n",
      "Sienna nodded. “Whatever it is, I think we need to find it. At least it would give us\n",

      "all is death.\n",
      " All morning he’d been running up against macabre symbols of biohazards,\n",
      "plagues, and Dante’s hell. Admittedly, he had no clear proof of what he was looking for,\n",
      "but he would be naive \n",
      "not to consider at least the possibility that this situation involved a\n",
      "deadly disease or large-scale biological threat. But if this were true, why would his own\n",
      "government be trying to eliminate him?\n",
      "Do they think I’m somehow involved in a potential attack?\n",
      "It made no sense at all. There was something else going on here.\n",

      "visions. I feel I need to find her.”\n",
      "“Then trust your feelings,” Sienna said. “In your condition, the best compass you have\n",
      "is your subconscious mind. It’s basic psychology—if your gut is telling you to trust that\n",
      "woman, then I think you should do exactly what she keeps telling you to do.”\n",
      "“Seek and find,” they said in unison.\n",
      "Langdon exhaled, knowing his path was clear.\n",
      "All I can do is keep swimming down this tunnel.\n",
      "With hardening resolve, he turned and began taking in his surroundings, trying to get\n",
      "his bearings. \n",
      "Which way out of the gardens?\n",
      "They were standing beneath the trees at the edge of a wide-open plaza where several\n",
      "paths intersected. In the distance to their left, Langdon spied an elliptical-shaped lagoon\n",
      "with a small island adorned with lemon trees and statuary. \n",
      "The Isolotto\n",
      ", he thought,\n",
      "recognizing the famous sculpture of Perseus on a half-submerged horse bounding through\n",
      "the water.\n",
      "“The Pitti Palace is that way,” Langdon said, pointing east, away from the Isolotto,\n",
      "toward the garden’s main thoroughfare—the Viottolone, which ran east–west along the\n",
      "entire length of the grounds. The Viottolone was as wide as a two-lane road and lined by\n",
      "a row of slender, four-hundred-year-old cypress trees.\n",
      "“There’s no cover,” Sienna said, eyeing the uncamouflaged avenue and motioning up at\n",
      "the circling drone.\n",
      "“You’re right,” Langdon said with a lopsided grin. “Which is why we’re taking the tunnel\n",
      "beside it.”He pointed again, this time to a dense hedgerow adjacent to the mouth of the\n",
      "Viottolone. The wall of dense greenery had a small arched opening cut into it. Beyond the\n",
      "opening, a slender footpath stretched out into the distance—a tunnel running parallel\n",
      "with the Viottolone. It was enclosed on either side by a phalanx of pruned holm oaks,\n",
      "which had been carefully trained since the 1600s to arch inward over the path,\n",
      "intertwining overhead and providing an awning of foliage. The pathway’s name, La\n",
      "Cerchiata—literally “circular” or “hooped”—derived from its canopy of curved trees\n",
      "resembling barrel stays or \n",
      "cerchi\n",

      "Sienna hurried over to the opening and peered into the shaded channel. Immediately\n",
      "she turned back to him with a smile. “Better.”\n",
      "Wasting no time, she slipped through the opening and hurried off among the trees.\n",
      "Langdon had always considered La Cerchiata one of Florence’s most peaceful spots.\n",
      "Today, however, as he watched Sienna disappear down the darkened allée, he thought\n",
      "again of the Grecian free divers swimming into corral tunnels and praying they’d reach an\n",

      "had tumbled down the long escarpment and \n",
      "landed in an elegant, barricade-like pile at\n",

      "“Look,” Sienna said, pointing to the nearest doors of the palace. “Good news.”\n",
      "Langdon had seen it, too. On this strange morning, the most welcome sight was not\n",
      "the palace itself, but the tourists streaming out of the building into the lower gardens.\n",
      "The palace was open, which meant that Langdon and Sienna would have no trouble\n",
      "slipping inside and passing through the building to escape the gardens. Once outside the\n",

      "spires of the old city.\n",
      "He and Sienna kept moving, half jogging now down the steep embankment. As they\n",
      "descended, they traversed the Boboli Amphitheater—the site of the very first opera\n",
      "performance in history—which lay nestled like a horseshoe on the side of a hill. Beyond\n",
      "that, they passed the obelisk of Ramses II and the unfortunate piece of “art” that waspositioned at its base. The guidebooks referred to the piece as “a colossal stone basin\n",

      "world’s largest bathtub. \n",
      "They really need to put that thing somewhere else.\n",
      "They finally reached the rear of the palace and slowed to a calm walk, mixing\n",

      "that led toward the palace’s main doors.\n",
      "As they neared the doorway, Langdon and Sienna collided with a growing bottleneck of\n",
      "stalled tourists who seemed to be assembling in the portico to observe something\n",
      "outside. Langdon peered through the crowd to the area in front of the palace.\n",
      "The Pitti’s grand entrance was as blunt and unwelcoming as he recalled it. Rather than\n",
      "a manicured lawn and landscaping, the front yard was a vast expanse of pavement that\n",
      "stretched across an entire hillside, flowing down to the Via dei Guicciardini like a massive\n",
      "paved ski slope.\n",
      "At the bottom of the hill, Langdon now saw the reason for the crowd of onlookers.\n",
      "Down in Piazza dei Pitti, a half-dozen police cars had streamed in from all directions. A\n",
      "small army of officers were advancing up the hill, unholstering their weapons and fanning\n",

      "retracing their steps through the interior of the palace and away from the arriving police.\n",
      "They hurried through the cortile and past the café, where a buzz was spreading, tourists\n",

      "Sienna was amazed the authorities had found them so quickly. \n",
      "The drone must have\n",
      "disappeared because it had already spotted us.\n",
      "She and Langdon found the same narrow tunnel through which they had descended\n",
      "from the gardens and without hesitation plunged back into the passageway and bounded\n",
      "up the stairs. The end of the staircase banked left along a high retaining wall. As they\n",
      "dashed along the wall, it grew shorter beside them, until finally they could see over it into\n",
      "the vast expanse of the Boboli Gardens.\n",

      "We’re trapped!\n",

      "This is more than I bargained for.\n",
      " When Sienna had left the hospital with\n",
      "Langdon, she thought they were fleeing a woman with spiked hair and a gun. Now they\n",
      "were running from an entire military team and the Italian authorities. Their chances of\n",
      "escape, she was now realizing, were almost zero.\n",
      "“Is there any other way out?” Sienna demanded, short of breath.\n",
      "“I don’t think so,” Langdon said. “This garden is a walled city, just like …” He paused\n",
      "suddenly, turning and looking east. “Just like … the Vatican.” A strange glint of hope\n",
      "flickered across his face.\n",
      "Sienna had no idea what the Vatican had to do with their current predicament, \n",
      "but\n",
      "Langdon suddenly began nodding, gazing east along the back of the palace.\n",
      "“It’s a long shot,” he said, hustling her along with him now. “But there might be a\n",
      "different way to get out of here.”\n",
      "Two figures materialized suddenly before them, having rounded the corner of the\n",
      "retaining wall, nearly bumping into Sienna and Langdon. Both figures were wearing black,\n",
      "and for one frightening instant, Sienna thought they were the soldiers she had\n",
      "encountered at the apartment building. As they passed, though, she saw they were only\n",
      "tourists—Italian, she guessed, from all the stylish black leather.\n",
      "Having an idea, Sienna caught one of the tourists’ arms and smiled up at him as\n",
      "warmly as possible. \n",
      "“Può dirci dov’è la Galleria del costume?”\n",
      " she asked in rapid Italian,\n",

      "“Io e mio fratello siamo in\n",
      "ritardo per una visita privata.” My brother and I are late for a private tour.“Certo!”\n",
      " The man grinned at them both, looking eager to help. \n",
      "“Proseguite dritto per il\n",
      "sentiero!”\n",
      " He turned and pointed west, along the retaining wall, directly away from\n",
      "whatever Langdon had been looking at.\n",
      "“Molte grazie!”\n",
      " Sienna chirped with another smile as the two men headed off.\n",
      "Langdon gave Sienna an impressed nod, apparently understanding her motives. If the\n",
      "police began questioning tourists, they might hear that Langdon and Sienna were headed\n",
      "for the costume gallery, which, according to the map on the wall before them, was at the\n",
      "far western end of the palace … as far as possible from the direction in which they were\n",
      "now headed.\n",
      "“We need to get to that path over there,” Langdon said, motioning across an open\n",
      "plaza toward a walkway that ran down another hill, away from the palace. The peastone\n",
      "walkway was sheltered on the uphill side by massive hedges, providing plenty of cover\n",
      "from the authorities now descending the hill, only a hundred yards away.\n",
      "Sienna calculated that their chances of getting across the open area to the sheltered\n",
      "path were very slim. Tourists were gathering there, watching the police with curiosity.\n",
      "The faint thrum of the drone became audible again, approaching in the distance.\n",
      "“Now or never,” Langdon said, grabbing her hand and pulling her with him out into the\n",
      "open plaza, where they began winding through the crowd of gathering tourists. Sienna\n",
      "fought the urge to break into a run, but Langdon held firmly on to her, walking briskly but\n",
      "calmly through the throng.\n",
      "When they finally reached the opening to the pathway, Sienna glanced back over her\n",
      "shoulder to see if they had been detected. The only police officers in sight were all facing\n",
      "the other way, their eyes turned skyward toward the sound of the incoming drone.\n",
      "She faced front and hurried with Langdon down the path.\n",
      "Before them now, the skyline of old Florence poked above the trees, visible directly\n",
      "ahead in the distance. She saw the red-tiled cupola of the Duomo and the green, red, and\n",
      "white spire of Giotto’s bell tower. For an instant, she could also make out the crenellated\n",
      "spire of the Palazzo Vecchio—their seemingly impossible destination—but as they\n",
      "descended the pathway, the high perimeter walls blotted out the view, engulfing them\n",
      "again.\n",
      "By the time they reached the bottom of the hill, Sienna was out of breath and\n",
      "wondering if Langdon had any idea where they were going. The path led directly into a\n",
      "maze garden, but Langdon confidently turned left into a wide gravel patio, which he\n",
      "skirted, staying behind a hedge in the shadows of the overhanging trees. The patio was\n",
      "deserted, more of an employee parking lot than a tourist area.\n",
      "“Where are we going?!” Sienna finally asked, breathless.\n",
      "“Almost there.”\n",
      "Almost where?\n",
      " The entire patio was enclosed by walls that were at least three stories\n",
      "tall. The only exit Sienna saw was a vehicle gateway on the left, which was sealed by a\n",
      "massive wrought-iron grate that looked like it dated back to the original palace in the\n",
      "days of marauding armies. Beyond the barricade, she could see police gathered in the\n",
      "Piazza dei Pitti.\n",
      "Staying along the perimeter vegetation, Langdon pushed onward, heading directly forthe wall in front of them. Sienna scanned the sheer face for any open doorway, but all\n",
      "she saw was a niche containing what had to be the most hideous statue she had ever\n",
      "seen.\n",
      "Good God, the Medici could afford any artwork on earth, and they chose this?\n",
      "The statue before them depicted an obese, naked dwarf straddling a giant turtle. The\n",
      "dwarf’s testicles were squashed against the turtle’s shell, and the turtle’s mouth was\n",
      "dribbling water, as if he were ill.\n",
      "“I know,” Langdon said, without breaking stride. “That’s \n",
      "Braccio di Bartolo\n",
      "—a famous\n",
      "court dwarf. If you ask me, they should put him out back in the giant bathtub.”\n",
      "Langdon turned sharply to his right, heading down a set of stairs that Sienna had been\n",
      "unable to see until now.\n",
      "A way out?!\n",
      "The flash of hope was short-lived.\n",
      "As she turned the corner and headed down the stairs behind Langdon, she realized\n",
      "they were dashing into a dead end—a cul-de-sac whose walls were twice as high as the\n",
      "others.\n",
      "Furthermore, Sienna now sensed that their long journey was about to terminate at the\n",
      "mouth of a gaping cavern … a deep grotto carved out of the rear wall. \n",
      "This can’t be\n",
      "where he’s taking us!\n",
      "Over the cave’s yawning entrance, daggerlike stalactites loomed portentously. In the\n",
      "cavity beyond, oozing geological features twisted and dripped down the walls as if the\n",
      "stone were melting … morphing into shapes that included, to Sienna’s alarm, half-buried\n",
      "humanoids extruding from the walls as if being consumed by the stone. The entire vision\n",
      "reminded Sienna of something out of Botticelli’s \n",
      "Mappa dell’Inferno.\n",
      "Langdon, for some reason, seemed unfazed, and continued running directly toward the\n",
      "cave’s entrance. He’d made a comment earlier about Vatican City, but Sienna was fairly\n",
      "certain there were no freakish caverns inside the walls of the Holy See.\n",
      "As they drew nearer, Sienna’s eyes moved to the sprawling entablature above the\n",
      "entrance—a ghostly compilation of stalactites and nebulous stone extrusions that seemed\n",
      "to be engulfing two reclining women, who were flanked by a shield embedded with six\n",
      "balls, or \n",
      "palle\n",
      ", the famed crest of the Medici.\n",
      "Langdon suddenly cut to his left, away from the entrance and toward a feature Sienna\n",
      "had previously missed—a small gray door to the left of the cavern. Weathered and\n",
      "wooden, it appeared of little significance, like a storage closet or room for landscaping\n",
      "supplies.\n",
      "Langdon rushed to the door, clearly hoping he could open it, but the door had no\n",
      "handle—only a brass keyhole—and, apparently, could be opened only from within.\n",
      "“Damn it!” Langdon’s eyes now shone with concern, his earlier hopefulness all but\n",
      "erased. “I had hoped—”\n",
      "Without warning, the piercing whine of the drone echoed loudly off the high walls\n",
      "around them. Sienna turned to see the drone rising up over the palace and clawing its\n",
      "way in their direction.\n",
      "Langdon clearly saw it, too, because he grabbed Sienna’s hand and dashed toward thecavern. They ducked out of sight in the nick of time beneath the grotto’s stalactite\n",

      "the deepest wall of the grotto.\n",
      "“All exits confirmed secure!” shouted a soldier somewhere outside. He was speaking\n",
      "English with a faint accent that Langdon couldn’t place. “Send the drone back up. I’ll\n",

      "Langdon could feel Sienna’s body tighten beside him.\n",
      "Seconds later, heavy boots were padding into the grotto. The footsteps advanced\n",

      "chamber, coming directly toward them.\n",
      "Langdon and Sienna huddled closer.\n",
      "“Hey!” a different voice shouted in the distance. “We’ve got them!”\n",
      "The footsteps stopped short.\n",
      "Langdon could now hear someone running loudly down the gravel walkway toward the\n",
      "grotto. “Positive ID!” the breathless voice declared. “We just spoke to a couple of\n",
      "tourists. A few minutes ago, the man and the woman asked them directions to the\n",
      "palace’s costume gallery … which is over at the west end of the palazzo.”\n",
      "Langdon glanced at Sienna, who seemed to be smiling ever so faintly.\n",

      "“Execute your mission,” the nearer soldier replied. “And call me the instant you’ve\n",
      "succeeded.”\n",
      "There was a flurry of departing footsteps on gravel, the sound of the drone lifting off\n",
      "again, and then, thankfully … total silence.\n",
      "Langdon was about to twist sideways in order to peer around the plinth, when Sienna\n",
      "grabbed his arm, stopping him. She held a finger to her lips and nodded at a faint\n",
      "humanoid shadow on the rear wall. The lead soldier was still standing silently in the\n",
      "mouth of the grotto.\n",
      "What is he waiting for?!\n",
      "“It’s Brüder,” he said suddenly. “We’ve got them cornered. I should have confirmation\n",
      "for you shortly.”\n",
      "The man had placed a phone call, and his voice sounded unnervingly close, as if he\n",
      "were standing right beside them. The cavern was acting like a parabolic microphone,\n",
      "collecting all the sound and focusing it at the rear.“There’s more,” Brüder said. “I just received an update from forensics. The woman’s\n",

      "were simply wandering, exploring the grotto as he talked on the phone.\n",
      "“Correct,” the man said. “Forensics also confirmed a single outbound call shortly before\n",
      "we stormed the apartment.”\n",
      "The U.S. Consulate\n",

      "quick arrival of the spike-haired assassin. The woman seemed to have disappeared,\n",
      "replaced by an entire team of trained soldiers.\n",
      "We can’t outrun them forever.\n",
      "The sound of the soldier’s boots on the stone floor was now only about twenty feet\n",
      "away and closing. The man had entered the second chamber, and if he continued to the\n",
      "end, he would certainly spot the two of them crouched behind \n",
      "Venus\n",
      "’s narrow base.\n",
      "“Sienna Brooks,” the man declared suddenly, the words crystal clear.\n",
      "Sienna startled beside Langdon, her eyes reeling upward, clearly expecting to see the\n",

      "“They’re going through her laptop now,” the voice continued, about ten feet away. “I\n",
      "don’t have a report yet, but it is definitely the same machine we traced when Langdon\n",
      "accessed his Harvard e-mail account.”\n",
      "On hearing this news, Sienna turned to Langdon in disbelief, gaping at him with an\n",
      "expression of shock … and then betrayal.\n",
      "Langdon was equally stunned. \n",
      "That’s how they tracked us?!\n",
      " It hadn’t even occurred to\n",
      "him at the time. \n",
      "I just needed information!\n",
      " Before Langdon could convey an apology,\n",
      "Sienna had turned away, her expression going blank.\n",
      "“That’s correct,” the soldier said, arriving at the entrance to the third chamber, a mere\n",
      "six feet from Langdon and Sienna. Two more steps and he would see them for certain.\n",
      "“Exactly,” he declared, taking one step closer. Suddenly the soldier paused. “Hold on a\n",
      "second.”\n",
      "Langdon froze, bracing to be discovered.\n",
      "“Hold on, I’m losing you,” the soldier said, and then retreated a few steps into the\n",
      "second chamber. “Bad connection. Go ahead …” He listened for a moment, then replied.\n",
      "“Yes, I agree, but at least we know who we’re dealing with.”\n",
      "With that, his footsteps faded out of the grotto, moved across a gravel surface, and\n",
      "then disappeared completely.\n",
      "Langdon’s shoulders softened, and he turned to Sienna, whose eyes burned with a\n",
      "mixture of fear and anger.\n",
      "“You used my laptop?!” she demanded. “To check your e-mail?”\n",
      "“I’m sorry … I thought you’d understand. I needed to find out—”\n",
      "“That’s how they found us! And now they know my name!”“I apologize, Sienna. I didn’t realize …” Langdon was racked by guilt.\n",
      "Sienna turned away, staring blankly at the bulbous stalagmite on the rear wall. Neither\n",
      "one of them said anything for nearly a minute. Langdon wondered if Sienna remembered\n",
      "the personal items that had been stacked on her desk—the playbill from \n",
      "A Midsummer\n",
      "Night’s Dream\n",
      " and press clippings about her life as a young prodigy. \n",
      "Does she suspect I\n",
      "saw them?\n",
      " If so, she wasn’t asking, and Langdon was in enough trouble with her already\n",
      "that he was not about to mention it.\n",
      "“They know who I am,” Sienna repeated, her voice so faint that Langdon could barely\n",
      "hear her. Over the next ten seconds, Sienna took several slow breaths, as if trying to\n",
      "absorb this new reality. As she did so, Langdon sensed that her resolve was slowly\n",
      "hardening.\n",
      "Without warning, Sienna scrambled to her feet. “We should go,” she said. “It won’t take\n",
      "long for them to figure out we’re not in the costume gallery.”\n",
      "Langdon stood up with her. “Yes, but go … where?”\n",
      "“Vatican City?”\n",
      "“I beg your pardon?”\n",
      "“I finally figured out what you meant before … what Vatican City has in common with\n",
      "the Boboli Gardens.” She motioned in the direction of the little gray door. “That’s the\n",
      "entrance, right?”\n",
      "Langdon managed a nod. “Actually, that’s the exit, but I figured it was worth a shot.\n",
      "Unfortunately, we can’t get through.” Langdon had heard enough of the guard’s exchange\n",
      "with the soldier to know this doorway was not an option.\n",
      "“But if we \n",
      "could\n",
      " get through,” Sienna said, a hint of mischief returning to her voice, “do\n",
      "you know what that would mean?” A faint smile now crossed her lips. “It would mean\n",
      "that twice today you and I have been helped by the same Renaissance artist.”\n",
      "Langdon had to chuckle, having had the same thought a few minutes ago. \n",
      "“Vasari.\n",
      "Vasari.”\n",
      "Sienna grinned more broadly now, and Langdon sensed she had forgiven him, at least\n",
      "for the moment. “I think it’s a sign from above,” she declared, sounding half serious. “We\n",
      "should go through that door.”\n",
      "“Okay … and we’ll just march right past the guard?”\n",
      "Sienna cracked her knuckles and headed out of the grotto. “No, I’ll have a word with\n",
      "him.” She glanced back at Langdon, the fire returning to her eyes. “Trust me, Professor, I\n",
      "can be quite persuasive when I have to be.”\n",
      "The pounding on the little gray door had returned.\n",
      "Firm and relentless.\n",
      "Security guard Ernesto Russo grumbled in frustration. The strange, cold-eyed soldier\n",
      "was apparently back, but his timing could not have been worse. The televised football\n",
      "match was in overtime with Fiorentina a man short and hanging by a thread.\n",
      "The pounding continued.\n",
      "Ernesto was no fool. He knew there was some kind of trouble out there this morning—all the sirens and soldiers—but he had never been one to involve himself in matters that\n",
      "didn’t affect him directly.\n",
      "Pazzo è colui che bada ai fatti altrui.\n",
      "Then again, the soldier was clearly someone of importance, and ignoring him was\n",
      "probably unwise. Jobs in Italy were hard to find these days, even boring ones. Stealing a\n",
      "last glance at the game, Ernesto headed off toward the pounding on the door.\n",
      "He still couldn’t believe he was paid to sit in his tiny office all day and \n",
      "watch television.\n",
      "Perhaps twice a day, a VIP tour would arrive outside the space, having walked all the way\n",
      "from the Uffizi Gallery. Ernesto would greet them, unlock the metal grate, and permit the\n",
      "group to pass through to the little gray door, where their tour would end in the Boboli\n",
      "Gardens.\n",
      "Now, as the pounding grew more intense, Ernesto opened the steel grate, moved\n",
      "through it, and then closed and locked it behind him.\n",
      "“Sì?”\n",
      " he shouted above the sounds of pounding as he hurried to the gray door.\n",
      "No reply. The pounding continued.\n",
      "Insomma!\n",
      " He finally unlocked the door and pulled it open, expecting to see the same\n",
      "lifeless gaze from a moment ago.\n",
      "But the face at the door was far more attractive.\n",
      "“Ciao,”\n",
      " a pretty blond woman said, smiling sweetly at him. She held out a folded piece\n",
      "of paper, which he instinctively reached out to accept. In the instant he grasped the\n",
      "paper and realized it was nothing but a piece of trash off the ground, the woman seized\n",
      "his wrist with her slender hands and plunged a thumb into the bony carpal area just\n",
      "beneath the palm of his hand.\n",
      "Ernesto felt as if a knife had just severed his wrist. The slicing stab was followed by an\n",
      "electric numbness. The woman stepped toward him, and the pressure increased\n",
      "exponentially, starting the pain cycle all over again. He staggered backward, trying to pull\n",
      "his arm free, but his legs went numb and buckled beneath him, and he slumped to his\n",
      "knees.\n",
      "The rest happened in an instant.\n",
      "A tall man in a dark suit appeared in the open doorway, slipped inside, and quickly\n",
      "closed the gray door behind him. Ernesto reached for his radio, but a soft hand behind his\n",
      "neck squeezed once, and his muscles seized up, leaving him gasping for breath. The\n",
      "woman took the radio as the tall man approached, looking as alarmed by her actions as\n",
      "Ernesto was.\n",
      "“Dim mak,”\n",

      "We don’t want to hurt you.\n",
      "The instant the pressure decreased, Ernesto tried to twist free, but the pressure\n",
      "promptly returned, and his muscles seized again. He gasped in pain, barely able to\n",
      "breathe.\n",
      "“Dobbiamo passare,”\n",

      "“Qual è la\n",

      "Something happened at the top of his spine, and Ernesto felt his entire body go limp.\n",
      "An instant later, he blacked out.\n",
      "When he came to, Ernesto sensed he had been drifting in and out of consciousness for\n",
      "several minutes. He recalled some discussion … more stabs of pain … being dragged,\n",
      "perhaps? It was all a blur.\n",
      "As the cobwebs cleared, he saw a strange sight—his shoes lying on the floor nearby\n",
      "with their laces removed. It was then that he realized he could barely move. He was lying\n",
      "on his side with his hands and feet bound behind him, apparently with his shoelaces. He\n",
      "tried to yell, but no sound came. One of his own socks was stuffed in his mouth. The true\n",
      "moment of fear, however, came an instant later, when he looked up and saw his\n",
      "television set playing the football match. \n",
      "I’m in my office … INSIDE the grate?!\n",
      "In the distance, Ernesto could hear the sound of running footsteps departing along the\n",

      "IL CORRIDOIO VASARIANO\n",
      "—the Vasari Corridor—was designed by Giorgio Vasari in 1564 under\n",
      "orders of the Medici ruler, Grand Duke Cosimo I, to provide safe passage from his\n",
      "residence at the Pitti Palace to his administrative offices, across the Arno River in the\n",
      "Palazzo Vecchio.\n",
      "Similar to Vatican City’s famed Passetto, the Vasari Corridor was the quintessential\n",
      "secret passageway. It stretched nearly a full kilometer from the eastern corner of the\n",
      "Boboli Gardens to the heart of the old palace itself, crossing the Ponte Vecchio and\n",
      "snaking through the Uffizi Gallery in between.\n",
      "Nowadays, the Vasari Corridor still served as a safe haven, although not for Medici\n",
      "aristocrats but for artwork; with its seemingly endless expanse of secure wall space, the\n",
      "corridor was home to countless rare paintings—overflow from the world-famous Uffizi\n",
      "Gallery, through which the corridor passed.\n",
      "Langdon had traveled the passageway a few years before as part of a leisurely private\n",
      "tour. On that afternoon, he had paused to admire the corridor’s mind-boggling array of\n",
      "paintings—including the most extensive collection of self-portraits in the world. He had\n",
      "also stopped several times to peer out of the corridor’s occasional viewing portals, which\n",
      "permitted travelers to gauge their progress along the elevated walkway.\n",
      "This morning, however, Langdon and Sienna were moving through the corridor at a\n",
      "run, eager to put as much distance as possible between themselves and their pursuers at\n",
      "the other end. Langdon wondered how long it would take for the bound guard to be\n",
      "discovered. As the tunnel stretched out before them, Langdon sensed it leading them\n",
      "closer with every step to what they were searching for.\n",
      "Cerca trova … the eyes of death … and an answer as to who is chasing me.\n",
      "The distant whine of the surveillance drone was far behind them \n",
      "now. The farther they\n",
      "progressed into the tunnel, the more Langdon was reminded of just how ambitious an\n",
      "architectural feat this passageway had been. Elevated above the city for nearly its entire\n",
      "length, the Vasari Corridor was like a broad serpent, snaking through the buildings, all the\n",
      "way from the Pitti Palace, across the Arno, into the heart of old Florence. The narrow,\n",
      "whitewashed passageway seemed to stretch for eternity, occasionally turning briefly left\n",
      "or right to avoid an obstacle, but always moving east … across the Arno.\n",
      "The sudden sound of voices echoed ahead of them in the corridor, and Sienna skidded\n",
      "to a stop. Langdon halted, too, and immediately placed a calm hand on her shoulder,\n",
      "motioning to a nearby viewing portal.\n",
      "Tourists down below.\n",
      "Langdon and Sienna moved to the portal and peered out, seeing that they were\n",
      "currently perched above the Ponte Vecchio—the medieval stone bridge that serves as a\n",
      "pedestrian walkway into the old city. Below them, the day’s first tourists were enjoying\n",
      "the market that has been held on the bridge since the 1400s. Today the vendors are\n",
      "mostly goldsmiths and jewelers, but that has not always been the case. Originally, thebridge had been home to Florence’s vast, open-air meat market, but the butchers were\n",
      "banished in 1593 after the rancid odor of spoiled meat had wafted up into the Vasari\n",
      "Corridor and assaulted the delicate nostrils of the grand duke.\n",
      "Down there on the bridge somewhere, Langdon recalled, was the precise spot where\n",
      "one of Florence’s most infamous crimes had been committed. In 1216, a young nobleman\n",
      "named Buondelmonte had rejected his family’s arranged marriage for the sake of his true\n",
      "love, and for that decision he was brutally killed on this very bridge.\n",
      "His death, long considered “Florence’s bloodiest murder,” was so named because it had\n",
      "triggered a rift between two powerful political factions—the Guelphs and Ghibellines—\n",
      "who had then waged war ruthlessly for centuries against each other. Because the ensuing\n",

      "to the alcove. To their left, in the distance, voices echoed up the corridor, calm and jovial.The Palazzo Vecchio, much like the United States Capitol Building, was both a tourist\n",

      "those of civic employees bustling in and out of offices, getting ready for the day.\n",
      "Langdon and Sienna inched toward the hallway and peered around the corner. Sure\n",
      "enough, at the end of the hallway was an atrium in which a dozen or so government\n",

      "they entered, Sienna began talking to him in rapid Italian—something about farm\n",
      "subsidies—gesticulating passionately as she spoke. They kept to the outer wall,\n",

      "Please tell me it’s not an indoor drone.\n",
      " Cautiously, Langdon peered around the corner of\n",
      "the portico. Thirty yards away stood the surprisingly simple wooden door that openedinto the Hall of the Five Hundred. Regrettably, directly between them stood a portly\n",
      "custodian pushing an electric floor-buffing machine in weary circles.\n",

      "journey through hell.”\n",

      ", and\n",
      "Paradiso\n",

      "entrance. “The reason the mask resides here in the Palazzo Vecchio has nothing to do\n",
      "with \n",
      "The Divine Comedy\n",
      ", though. It has to do with real history. Dante lived in Florence,\n",
      "and he loved this city as much as anyone could ever love a city. He was a very prominent\n",
      "and powerful Florentine, but there was a shift in political power, and Dante supported the\n",
      "wrong side, so he was exiled—thrown outside the city walls and told he could never come\n",
      "back.”\n",
      "Marta paused to catch her breath as they approached the museum entrance. Hands\n",
      "again on her hips, she leaned back and continued talking. “Some people claim that\n",
      "Dante’s exile is the reason why his death mask looks so sad, but I have another theory.\n",
      "I’m a bit of a romantic, and I think the sad face has more to do with a woman named\n",
      "Beatrice. You see, Dante spent his entire life desperately in love with a young woman\n",
      "named Beatrice Portinari. But sadly, Beatrice married another man, which meant Dante\n",
      "had to live not only without his beloved Florence, but also without the woman he sodeeply loved. His love for Beatrice became a central theme in \n",
      "The Divine Comedy\n",

      "I’m still not clear on why the death mask is kept here inside the palazzo?”\n",
      "Marta found the young woman’s insistence both unusual and bordering on impolite.\n",
      "“Well,” she continued, walking again, “when Dante died, he was still forbidden to enter\n",
      "Florence, and his body was buried in Ravenna. But because his true love, Beatrice, was\n",
      "buried in Florence, and because Dante so loved Florence, bringing his death mask here\n",
      "seemed like a kindhearted tribute to the man.”\n",
      "“I see,” Sienna said. “And the choice of this building in particular?”\n",
      "“The Palazzo Vecchio is the oldest symbol of Florence and, in Dante’s time, was the\n",
      "heart of the city. In fact, there is a famous painting in the cathedral that shows Dante\n",

      "“Sono io, Marta!\n",

      "“È un po’ presto,”\n",
      " he said with a smile. \n",
      "A little early.\n",
      "By way of explanation, Marta motioned to Langdon, and the guard immediately\n",
      "brightened. \n",
      "“Signore! Bentornato!” Welcome back!\n",
      "“Grazie,”\n",
      " Langdon replied amiably as the guard motioned them all inside.\n",
      "They moved through a small foyer, where the guard disarmed a security system and\n",
      "then unlocked a second, heavier door. As the door swung open, he stepped aside,\n",
      "sweeping his arm out with a flourish. \n",
      "“Ecco il museo!”\n",
      "Marta smiled her thanks and led her guests inside.\n",
      "The space that made up this museum had originally been designed as government\n",
      "offices, which meant that rather than a sprawling, wide-open gallery space, it was a\n",
      "labyrinth of moderate-size rooms and hallways, which encircled half of the building.\n",
      "“The Dante death mask is around the corner,” Marta told Sienna. “It’s displayed in a\n",
      "narrow space called \n",
      "l’andito\n",
      ", which is essentially just a walkway between two larger\n",
      "rooms. An antique cabinet against the sidewall holds the mask, which keeps it invisible\n",
      "until you draw even with it. For this reason, many visitors walk right past the mask\n",
      "without even noticing it!”\n",
      "Langdon was striding faster now, eyes straight ahead, as if the mask held some kind of\n",
      "strange power over him. Marta nudged Sienna and whispered, “Obviously, your brother is\n",
      "not interested in any of our other pieces, but as long as you’re here, you shouldn’t miss\n",
      "our bust of Machiavelli or the \n",
      "Mappa Mundi\n",
      " globe in the Hall of Maps.”\n",
      "Sienna nodded politely and kept moving, her eyes also straight ahead. Marta was\n",
      "barely able to keep pace. As they reached the third room, she had fallen behind a bit and\n",
      "finally stopped short.\n",
      "“Professor?” she called out, panting. “Perhaps you … want to show your sister … some\n",
      "of the gallery … before we see his mask?”Langdon turned, seeming distracted, as if returning to the present from some far-off\n",
      "thought. “Excuse me?”\n",
      "Marta breathlessly pointed to a nearby display case. “One of the earliest … printed\n",
      "copies of \n",
      "The Divine Comedy\n",
      "?”\n",
      "When Langdon finally saw Marta dabbing her forehead and trying to catch her breath,\n",
      "he looked mortified. “Marta, forgive me! Of course, yes, a quick glance at the text would\n",
      "be wonderful.”\n",
      "Langdon hurried back, permitting Marta to guide them over to the antique case. Inside\n",
      "was a well-worn, leather-bound book, propped open to an ornate title page: \n",
      "La Divina\n",
      "Commedia: Dante Alighieri\n",
      ".\n",
      "“Incredible,” Langdon said, sounding surprised. “I recognize the frontispiece. I didn’t\n",
      "know you had one of the original Numeister editions.”\n",
      "Of course you knew\n",
      ", Marta thought, puzzled. \n",
      "I showed this to you last night!\n",
      "“In the mid–fourteen hundreds,” Langdon said hurriedly to Sienna, “Johann Numeister\n",
      "created the first printed edition of this work. Several hundred copies were printed, but\n",
      "only about a dozen survived. They’re very rare.”\n",
      "It now seemed to Marta that Langdon had been playing dumb so he could show off for\n",
      "his younger sibling. It seemed a rather unbecoming immodesty for a professor whose\n",
      "reputation was one of academic humility.\n",
      "“This copy is on loan from the Laurentian Library,” Marta offered. “If you and Robert\n",
      "have not visited there, you should. They have a spectacular staircase designed by\n",
      "Michelangelo, which leads up to the world’s first public reading room. The books there\n",
      "were actually chained to the seats so nobody could take them out. Of course, many of the\n",
      "books were the \n",
      "only\n",
      " copies in the world.”\n",
      "“Amazing,” Sienna said, glancing deeper into the museum. “And the mask is this way?”\n",
      "What’s the hurry?\n",
      " Marta needed another minute to regain her breath. “Yes, but you\n",
      "might be interested to hear about this.” She pointed across an alcove toward a small\n",
      "staircase that disappeared into the ceiling. “That goes up to a viewing platform in the\n",
      "rafters where you can actually look \n",
      "down\n",
      " on Vasari’s famous hanging ceiling. I’d be happy\n",
      "to wait here if you’d like to—”\n",
      "“Please, Marta,” Sienna interjected. “I’d love to see the mask. We’re a little short on\n",
      "time.”\n",
      "Marta stared at the pretty, young woman, perplexed. She very much disliked the new\n",
      "fashion of strangers calling each other by their first names. \n",
      "I’m Signora Alvarez\n",
      ", she\n",
      "silently chided. \n",
      "And I’m doing you a favor.\n",
      "“Okay, Sienna,” Marta said curtly. “The mask is right this way.”\n",
      "Marta wasted no more time offering Langdon and his sister informed commentary as\n",
      "they made their way through the winding suite of gallery rooms toward the mask. Last\n",
      "night, Langdon and \n",
      "il Duomino\n",
      " had spent nearly a half hour in the narrow \n",
      "andito\n",
      ", viewing\n",
      "the mask. Marta, intrigued by the men’s curiosity for the piece, had asked if their\n",
      "fascination was related somehow to the unusual series of events surrounding the mask\n",
      "over this past year. Langdon and \n",
      "il Duomino\n",
      " had been coy, offering no real answer.\n",
      "Now, as they approached the \n",
      "andito\n",
      ", Langdon began explaining to his sister the simpleprocess used to create a death mask. His description, Marta was pleased to hear, was\n",
      "perfectly accurate, unlike his bogus claim that he had not previously seen the museum’s\n",
      "rare copy of \n",
      "The Divine Comedy\n",
      ".\n",
      "“Shortly after death,” Langdon described, “the deceased is laid out, and his face is\n",
      "coated with olive oil. Then a layer of wet plaster is caked onto the skin, covering\n",
      "everything—mouth, nose, eyelids—from the hairline down to the neck. Once hardened,\n",
      "the plaster is easily lifted off and used as a mold into which fresh plaster is poured. This\n",
      "plaster hardens into a perfectly detailed replica of the deceased’s face. The practice was\n",
      "particularly widespread in commemorating eminent persons and men of genius—Dante,\n",
      "Shakespeare, Voltaire, Tasso, Keats—they all had death masks made.”\n",
      "“And here we are at last,” Marta announced as the trio arrived outside the \n",
      "andito\n",
      ". She\n",
      "stepped aside and motioned for Langdon’s sister to enter first. “The mask is in the display\n",
      "case against the wall on your left. We ask that you please stay outside the stanchions.”\n",
      "“Thank you.” Sienna entered the narrow corridor, walked toward the display case, and\n",
      "peered inside. Her eyes instantly went wide, and she glanced back at her brother with an\n",
      "expression of dread.\n",
      "Marta had seen the reaction a thousand times; visitors were often jolted and repulsed\n",
      "by their first glimpse of the mask—Dante’s eerily crinkled visage, hooked nose, and\n",
      "closed eyes.\n",
      "Langdon strode in right behind Sienna, arriving beside her and looking into the display\n",
      "case. He immediately stepped back, his face also registering surprise.\n",
      "Marta groaned. \n",
      "Che esagerato.\n",
      " She followed them in. But when she gazed into the\n",
      "cabinet, she, too, gasped out loud. \n",
      "Oh mio Dio!\n",

      "instead, all she saw was the red satin interior of the cabinet and the peg on which the\n",

      "Marta covered her mouth and stared in horror at the empty display case. Her breathing\n",
      "accelerated and she grabbed one of the stanchions for support. Finally, she tore her eyes\n",

      "“Who?” Marta frowned, still staring at the screen. “Well, you probably read about him in\n",
      "the news recently—the Swiss billionaire Bertrand Zobrist?”For Langdon the name seemed only vaguely familiar, but Sienna grabbed Langdon’s\n",
      "arm and squeezed it hard, looking as if she’d seen a ghost.\n",
      "“Oh, yes …” Sienna said haltingly, her face ashen. “Bertrand Zobrist. Famous\n",

      "Langdon had no idea what germ-line manipulation was, but it had an ominous ring,\n",
      "especially in light of the recent spate of images involving plagues and death. He\n",

      "in Europe in the 1300s. Prior to the plague, overpopulation, famine, and economic\n",

      "Renaissance.\n",
      "As Langdon pictured the biohazard symbol on the tube that had contained the modified\n",

      "created by \n",
      "someone\n",

      "Without hesitation, Sienna hurried through the opening, moving fearlessly into the dim\n",
      "space beyond. Langdon followed her and quickly pulled the wall closed behind them.\n",
      "Despite his foggy recollections of the secret passages tour, Langdon recalled this\n",
      "passageway clearly. He and Sienna had just passed, as it were, through the looking glass\n",
      "into the Palazzo Invisibile—the clandestine world that existed \n",
      "behind\n",
      " the walls of the\n",
      "Palazzo Vecchio—a secret domain that had been accessible solely to the then-reigning\n",
      "duke and those closest to him.\n",
      "Langdon paused a moment inside the doorway and took in their new surroundings—a\n",
      "pale stone hallway lit only by faint natural light that filtered through a series of leaded\n",
      "windows. The passageway descended fifty yards or so to a wooden door.\n",
      "He turned now to his left, where a narrow ascending staircase was blocked by a chain\n",
      "swag. A sign above the stairs warned: \n",
      "USCITA VIETATA\n",
      ".\n",
      "Langdon headed for the stairs.\n",
      "“No!” Sienna warned. “It says ‘No Exit.’ ”\n",
      "“Thanks,” Langdon said with a wry smile. “I can read the Italian.”\n",
      "He unhooked the chain swag, carried it back to the secret door, and quickly used it to\n",
      "immobilize the rotating wall—threading the chain through the door handle and around a\n",
      "nearby fixture so the door could not be pulled open from the other side.\n",
      "“Oh,” Sienna said sheepishly. “Good thinking.”\n",
      "“It won’t keep them out for long,” Langdon said. “But we won’t need much time. Follow\n",
      "me.”\n",
      "When the map of Armenia finally crashed open, Agent Brüder and his men streamed\n",
      "down the narrow corridor in pursuit, heading for the wooden door at the far end. When\n",
      "they burst through, Brüder felt a blast of cold air hit him head-on, and was momentarily\n",
      "blinded by bright sunlight.\n",
      "He had arrived on an exterior walkway, which threaded along the rooftop of the\n",
      "palazzo. His eye traced the path, which led directly to another door, some fifty yards\n",
      "away, and reentered the building.\n",
      "Brüder glanced to the left of the walkway, where the high, vaulted roof of the Hall of\n",
      "the Five Hundred rose like a mountain. \n",
      "Impossible to traverse\n",
      ". Brüder turned now to his\n",
      "right, where the walkway was bordered by a sheer cliff that plummeted down into a deep\n",
      "light well. \n",
      "Instant death\n",
      ".\n",
      "His eyes refocused straight ahead. “This way!”\n",
      "Brüder and his men dashed along the walkway toward the second door while the\n",
      "surveillance drone circled like a vulture overhead.\n",
      "When Brüder and his men burst through the doorway, they all slid to an abrupt stop,\n",
      "nearly piling up on one another.\n",
      "They were standing in a tiny stone chamber that had no exit other than the door\n",
      "through which they had just come. A lone wooden desk stood against the wall. Overhead,the grotesque figures depicted in the chamber’s ceiling frescoes seemed to stare down at\n",
      "them mockingly.\n",
      "It was a dead end.\n",
      "One of Brüder’s men hurried over and scanned the informational placard on the wall.\n",
      "“Hold on,” he said. “This says there’s a \n",
      "finestra\n",
      " in here—some kind of secret window?”\n",
      "Brüder looked around but saw no secret window. He marched over and read the\n",
      "placard himself.\n",
      "Apparently this space had once been the private study of Duchess Bianca Cappello and\n",
      "included a secret window—\n",
      "una finestra segrata\n",
      "—through which Bianca could covertly\n",
      "watch her husband deliver speeches down below in the Hall of the Five Hundred.\n",
      "Brüder’s eyes searched the room again, now locating a small lattice-covered opening\n",
      "discreetly hidden in the sidewall. \n",
      "Did they escape through there?\n",
      "He stalked over and examined the opening, which appeared to be too small for\n",
      "someone of Langdon’s size to get through. Brüder pressed his \n",
      "face to the grid and peered\n",
      "through, confirming for certain that nobody had escaped this way; on the other side of\n",
      "the lattice was a sheer drop, straight down several stories, to the floor of the Hall of the\n",
      "Five Hundred.\n",
      "So where the hell did they go?!\n",
      "As Brüder turned back in to the tiny stone chamber, he felt all of the day’s frustration\n",
      "mounting within him. In a rare moment of unrestrained emotion, Agent Brüder threw\n",
      "back his head and let out a bellow of rage.\n",
      "The noise was deafening in the tiny space.\n",
      "Far below, in the Hall of the Five Hundred, tourists and police officers all spun and\n",
      "stared up at the latticed opening high on the wall. From the sounds of things, the\n",
      "duchess’s secret study was now being used to cage a wild animal.\n",
      "Sienna Brooks and Robert Langdon stood in total darkness.\n",
      "Minutes earlier, Sienna had watched Langdon cleverly use the chain to seal the rotating\n",
      "map of Armenia, then turn and flee.\n",
      "To her surprise, however, instead of heading down the corridor, Langdon had gone up\n",
      "the steep staircase that had been marked \n",
      "USCITA VIETATA\n",
      ".\n",
      "“Robert!” she whispered in confusion. “The sign said ‘No Exit’! And besides, I thought\n",
      "we wanted to go \n",
      "down\n",
      "!”\n",
      "“We do,” Langdon said, glancing over his shoulder. “But sometimes you need to go up\n",
      "… to go down.” He gave her an encouraging wink. “Remember Satan’s navel?”\n",
      "What is he talking about?\n",
      " Sienna bounded after him, feeling lost.\n",
      "“Did you ever read \n",
      "Inferno\n",
      "?” Langdon asked.\n",
      "Yes … but I think I was seven.\n",
      "An instant later, it dawned on her. “Oh, Satan’s navel!” she said. “Now I remember.”\n",
      "It had taken a moment, but Sienna now realized that Langdon was referring to the\n",
      "finale of Dante’s \n",
      "Inferno\n",
      ". In these cantos, in order to escape hell, Dante has to climb\n",
      "down the hairy stomach of the massive Satan, and when he reaches Satan’s navel—thealleged center of the earth—the earth’s gravity suddenly switches directions, and Dante,\n",
      "in order to continue climbing \n",
      "down\n",
      " to purgatory … suddenly has to start climbing \n",
      "up\n",
      ".\n",
      "Sienna remembered little of the \n",
      "Inferno\n",
      " other than her disappointment in witnessing\n",
      "the absurd actions of gravity at the center of the earth; apparently Dante’s genius did not\n",
      "include a grasp of the physics of vector forces.\n",
      "They reached the top of the stairs, and Langdon opened the lone door they found\n",
      "there; on it was written: \n",
      "SALA DEI MODELLI DI ARCHITETTURA\n",
      ".\n",
      "Langdon ushered her inside, closing and bolting the door behind them.\n",
      "The room was small and plain, containing a series of cases that displayed wooden\n",
      "models of Vasari’s architectural designs for the interior of the palazzo. Sienna barely\n",
      "noticed the models. She did, however, notice that the room had no doors, no windows,\n",
      "and, as advertised … \n",
      "no exit.\n",
      "“In the mid-1300s,” Langdon whispered, “the Duke of Athens assumed power in the\n",
      "palace and built this secret escape route in case he was attacked. It’s called the Duke of\n",
      "Athens Stairway, and it descends to a tiny escape hatch on a side street. If we can get\n",
      "there, nobody will see us exit.” He pointed to one of the models. “Look. See it there on\n",
      "the side?”\n",
      "He brought me up here to show me models?\n",
      "Sienna shot an anxious glance at the miniature and saw the secret staircase\n",
      "descending all the way from the top of the palace down to street level, stealthily hidden\n",
      "between the inner and outer walls of the building.\n",
      "“I can see the stairs, Robert,” Sienna said testily, “but they are on the complete\n",
      "opposite\n",
      " side of the palace. We’ll never get over there!”\n",
      "“A little faith,” he said with a lopsided grin.\n",
      "A sudden crash emanating from downstairs told them that the map of Armenia had just\n",
      "been breached. They stood stone-still as they listened to the footfalls of soldiers\n",
      "departing down the corridor, none of them ever thinking that their quarry would climb\n",
      "higher still … especially up a tiny staircase marked \n",
      "NO EXIT\n",
      ".\n",
      "When the sounds below had subsided, Langdon strode with confidence across the\n",
      "exhibit room, snaking through the displays, heading directly for what looked like a large\n",
      "cupboard in the far wall. The cupboard was about one yard square and positioned three\n",
      "feet off the floor. Without hesitation, Langdon grabbed the handle and heaved open the\n",
      "door.\n",
      "Sienna recoiled with surprise.\n",
      "The space within appeared to be a cavernous void … as if the cupboard door were a\n",
      "portal into another world. Beyond was only blackness.\n",
      "“Follow me,” Langdon said.\n",
      "He grabbed a lone flashlight that was hanging on the wall beside the opening. Then,\n",
      "with surprising agility and strength, the professor hoisted himself up through the opening\n",
      "and disappeared into the rabbit hole.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chapter 46:\n",
      "CHAPTER 46\n",
      "LA SOFFITTA\n",
      ", LANGDON\n",
      " thought. \n",
      "The most dramatic attic on earth.\n",
      "The air inside the void smelled musty and ancient, as if centuries of plaster dust had\n",
      "now become so fine and light that it refused to settle and instead hung suspended in the\n",
      "atmosphere. The vast space creaked and groaned, giving Langdon the sense that he had\n",
      "just climbed into the belly of a living beast.\n",
      "Once he had found solid footing on a broad horizontal truss chord, he raised his\n",
      "flashlight, letting the beam pierce the darkness.\n",
      "Spreading out before him was a seemingly endless tunnel, crisscrossed by a wooden\n",
      "web of triangles and rectangles formed by the intersections of posts, beams, chords, and\n",
      "other structural elements that made up the invisible skeleton of the Hall of the Five\n",
      "Hundred.\n",
      "This enormous attic space was one Langdon had viewed during his Nebbiolo-fogged\n",
      "secret passages tour a few years ago. The cupboardlike viewing window had been cut in\n",
      "the wall of the architectural-model room so visitors could inspect the models of the truss\n",
      "work and then peer through the opening with a flashlight and see the real thing.\n",
      "Now that Langdon was actually inside the garret, he was surprised by how much the\n",
      "truss architecture resembled that of an old New England barn—traditional king post-and-\n",
      "strut assembly with “Jupiter’s arrow point” connections.\n",
      "Sienna had also climbed through the opening and now steadied herself on the beam\n",
      "beside him, looking disoriented. Langdon swung the flashlight back and forth to show her\n",
      "the unusual landscape.\n",
      "From this end, the view down the length of the garret was like peering through a long\n",
      "line of isosceles triangles that telescoped into the distance, extending out toward some\n",
      "distant vanishing point. Beneath their feet, the garret had no floorboards, and its\n",
      "horizontal supporting beams were entirely exposed, resembling a series of massive\n",
      "railroad ties.\n",
      "Langdon pointed straight down the long shaft, speaking in hushed \n",
      "tones. “This space is\n",
      "directly \n",
      "over\n",
      " the Hall of the Five Hundred. If we can get to the other end, I know how to\n",
      "reach the Duke of Athens Stairway.”\n",
      "Sienna cast a skeptical eye into the labyrinth of beams and supports that stretched\n",
      "before them. The only apparent way to advance through the garret would be to jump\n",
      "between the struts like kids on a train track. The struts were large—each consisting of\n",
      "numerous beams strapped together with wide iron clasps into a single powerful sheaf—\n",
      "plenty large enough to balance on. The challenge, however, was that the separation\n",
      "between the struts was much too far to leap across safely.\n",
      "“I can’t possibly jump between those beams,” Sienna whispered.\n",
      "Langdon doubted he could either, and falling would be certain death. He aimed the\n",
      "flashlight down through the open space between the struts.\n",
      "Eight feet below them, suspended by iron rods, hung a dusty horizontal expanse—afloor of sorts—which extended as far as they could see. Despite its appearance of solidity,\n",
      "Langdon knew the floor consisted primarily of stretched fabric covered in dust. This was\n",
      "the “back side” of the Hall of the Five Hundred’s suspended ceiling—a sprawling expanse\n",
      "of wooden lacunars that framed thirty-nine Vasari canvases, all mounted horizontally in a\n",
      "kind of patchwork-quilt configuration.\n",
      "Sienna pointed down to the dusty expanse beneath them. “Can we climb down there\n",
      "and walk across?”\n",
      "Not unless you want to fall through a Vasari canvas into the Hall of the Five Hundred.\n",
      "“Actually, there’s a better way,” Langdon said calmly, not wanting to frighten her. He\n",
      "began moving down the strut toward the central backbone of the garret.\n",
      "On his previous visit, in addition to peering through the viewing window in the room of\n",
      "architectural models, Langdon had explored the garret on foot, entering through a\n",
      "doorway at the \n",
      "other\n",
      " end of the attic. If his wine-impaired memory served him, a sturdy\n",
      "boardwalk ran along the central spine of the garret, providing tourists access to a large\n",
      "viewing deck in the center of the space.\n",
      "However, when Langdon arrived at the center of the strut, he found a boardwalk that\n",
      "in no way resembled the one he recalled from his tour.\n",
      "How much Nebbiolo did I drink that day?\n",
      "Rather than a sturdy, tourist-worthy structure, he was looking at a hodgepodge of loose\n",
      "planks that had been laid perpendicularly across the beams to create a rudimentary\n",
      "catwalk—more of a tightrope than a bridge.\n",
      "Apparently, the sturdy tourist walkway that originated at the other end extended only\n",
      "as far as the central viewing platform. From there, the tourists evidently retraced their\n",
      "steps. This jerry-rigged balance beam that Langdon and Sienna now faced was most\n",
      "likely installed so engineers could service the remaining attic space at this end.\n",
      "“Looks like we’re walking the plank,” Langdon said, eyeing the narrow boards with\n",
      "uncertainty.\n",
      "Sienna shrugged, unfazed. “No worse than Venice in flood season.”\n",
      "Langdon realized she had a point. On his most recent research trip to Venice, St. Mark’s\n",
      "Square had been under a foot of water, and he had walked from the Hotel Danieli to the\n",
      "basilica on wooden planks propped between cinder blocks and inverted buckets. Of\n",
      "course, the prospect of possibly getting one’s loafers wet was a far cry from that of\n",
      "plunging through a Renaissance masterpiece to one’s death.\n",
      "Pushing the thought from his mind, Langdon stepped out onto the narrow board with a\n",
      "feigned self-assurance that he hoped would calm any worries Sienna might secretly be\n",
      "harboring. Nonetheless, despite his confident exterior, his heart was pounding as he\n",
      "moved across the first plank. As he neared the middle, the plank bowed beneath his\n",
      "weight, creaking ominously. He pressed on, faster now, finally reaching the other side\n",
      "and the relative safety of the second strut.\n",
      "Exhaling, Langdon turned to shine the light for Sienna and also offer any coaxing words\n",
      "she might need. She apparently needed none. As soon as his beam illuminated the plank,\n",
      "she was skimming along its length with remarkable dexterity. The board barely bent\n",
      "beneath her slender body, and within seconds she had joined him on the other side.Encouraged, Langdon turned back and headed out across the next plank. Sienna waited\n",
      "until he had crossed and could turn around and shine the light for her, and then she\n",
      "followed, staying right with him. Settling into a steady rhythm, they pressed on—two\n",
      "figures moving one after the other by the light of a single flashlight. From somewhere\n",
      "beneath them, the sound of police walkie-talkies crackled up through the thin ceiling.\n",
      "Langdon permitted himself a faint smile. \n",
      "We’re hovering above the Hall of the Five\n",
      "Hundred, weightless and invisible.\n",
      "“So, Robert,” Sienna whispered. “You said Ignazio told you where to find the mask?”\n",
      "“He did … but in a kind of code.” Langdon quickly explained that Ignazio had\n",
      "apparently not wanted to blurt out the mask’s location on the answering machine, and so\n",
      "he had shared the information in a more cryptic manner. “He referenced paradise, which I\n",
      "assume is an allusion \n",
      "to the final section of \n",
      "The Divine Comedy\n",
      ". His exact words were\n",
      "‘Paradise Twenty-five.’ ”\n",
      "Sienna glanced up. “He must mean \n",
      "Canto\n",
      " Twenty-five.”\n",
      "“I agree,” Langdon said. A \n",
      "canto\n",
      " was the rough equivalent of a chapter, the word\n",
      "harkening back to the oral tradition of “singing” epic poems. \n",
      "The Divine Comedy\n",
      "contained precisely one hundred cantos in all, divided into three sections.\n",
      "Inferno\n",
      " 1–34\n",
      "Purgatorio\n",
      " 1–33\n",
      "Paradiso\n",
      " 1–33\n",
      "Paradise Twenty-five\n",
      ", Langdon thought, wishing his eidetic memory were strong\n",
      "enough to recall the entire text. \n",
      "Not even close—we need to find a copy of the text.\n",
      "“There’s more,” Langdon continued. “The last thing Ignazio said to me was: \n",
      "‘The gates\n",
      "are open to you, but you must hurry.’\n",
      " ” He paused, glancing back at Sienna. “Canto\n",
      "Twenty-five probably makes reference to a specific location here in Florence. Apparently,\n",
      "someplace with gates.”\n",
      "Sienna frowned. “But this city probably has dozens of gates.”\n",
      "“Yes, which is why we need to read Canto Twenty-five of \n",
      "Paradise\n",
      ".” He gave her a\n",
      "hopeful smile. “You don’t, by any chance, know the entire \n",
      "Divine Comedy\n",
      " by heart, do\n",
      "you?”\n",
      "She gave him a dumb look. “Fourteen thousand lines of archaic Italian that I read as a\n",
      "kid?” She shook her head. “You’re the one with the freakish memory, Professor. I’m just a\n",
      "doctor.”\n",
      "As they pressed on, Langdon found it sad somehow that Sienna, even after all they’d\n",
      "been through together, apparently still preferred to withhold the truth about her\n",
      "exceptional intellect. \n",
      "She’s just a doctor?\n",
      " Langdon had to chuckle. \n",
      "Most humble doctor on\n",
      "earth\n",
      ", he thought, recalling the clippings he’d read about her special skills—skills that,\n",
      "unfortunately but not surprisingly, did not include total recall of one of history’s longest\n",
      "epic poems.\n",
      "In silence, they continued on, crossing several more beams. Finally, up ahead Langdon\n",
      "saw a heartening shape in the darkness. \n",
      "The viewing platform!\n",
      " The precarious plankingon which they were walking led directly to a much sturdier structure with guardrails. If\n",
      "they climbed onto the platform, they could continue on along the walkway until they\n",
      "exited the garret through a doorway, which, as Langdon recalled, was very close to the\n",
      "Duke of Athens Stairway.\n",
      "As they neared the platform, Langdon glanced down at the ceiling suspended eight feet\n",
      "below. So far all the lunettes beneath them had been similar. The upcoming lunette,\n",
      "however, was massive—far larger than the others.\n",
      "The Apotheosis of Cosimo I\n",
      ", Langdon mused.\n",
      "This vast, circular lunette was Vasari’s most precious painting—the central lunette in\n",
      "the entire Hall of the Five Hundred. Langdon often showed slides of this work to his\n",
      "students, pointing out its similarities to \n",
      "The Apotheosis of Washington\n",
      " in the U.S. Capitol\n",
      "—a humble reminder that fledgling America had adopted far more from Italy than merely\n",
      "the concept of a republic.\n",
      "Today, however, Langdon was more interested in hurrying past the \n",
      "Apotheosis\n",
      " than in\n",
      "studying it. As he hastened his pace, he turned his head ever so slightly to whisper back\n",
      "to Sienna that they were nearly there.\n",
      "As he did so, his right foot missed the center of the plank and his borrowed loafer\n",
      "landed half off the edge. His ankle rolled, and Langdon lurched forward, half stumbling,\n",
      "half running, trying to make a quick stutter step to regain his balance.\n",
      "But it was too late.\n",
      "His knees hit the plank hard, and his hands strained desperately forward, trying to\n",
      "reach the crossing strut. The flashlight went clattering into the dark space beneath them,\n",
      "landing on the canvas, which caught it like a net. Langdon’s legs pumped, barely\n",
      "propelling him to safety on the next strut as the plank fell away beneath him, landing\n",
      "with a crash eight feet below on the wooden lacunar surrounding the canvas of Vasari’s\n",
      "Apotheosis\n",
      ".\n",
      "The sound echoed through the garret.\n",
      "Horrified, Langdon scrambled to his feet and turned back toward Sienna.\n",
      "In the dim glow of the abandoned flashlight, which lay on the canvas below, Langdon\n",
      "could see that Sienna was standing on the strut behind him, now trapped, with no way\n",
      "across. Her eyes conveyed what Langdon already knew. The noise of the falling plank\n",
      "had almost certainly given them away.\n",
      "Vayentha’s eyes bolted upward to the ornate ceiling.\n",
      "“Rats in the attic?” the man with the camcorder joked nervously as the sound\n",
      "reverberated down.\n",
      "Big rats\n",
      ", Vayentha thought, gazing up at the circular painting in the center of the hall’s\n",
      "ceiling. A small cloud of dust was now filtering down from between the lacunars, and\n",
      "Vayentha could swear she saw a slight bulge in the canvas … almost as if someone were\n",
      "pushing on it from the other side.\n",
      "“Maybe one of the officers dropped his gun off the viewing platform,” the man said,\n",

      "darkness behind him, apparently looking for something … or someone else. As the beam\n",
      "left his eyes, Langdon could just make out the silhouette of the person now blocking his\n",

      "Something was approaching behind her.\n",
      "Approaching fast.\n",

      "flash of blond hair glinted in the darkness as someone collided with Vayentha at full\n",
      "speed. The gun hissed again, but the person had crouched below barrel level in order toapply a forceful upward body check.\n",
      "Vayentha’s feet left the floor and her midsection crashed hard into the low railing of the\n",
      "viewing platform. As her torso was propelled out over \n",
      "the railing, she flailed her arms,\n",
      "trying to grab onto anything to stop her fall, but it was too late. She went over the edge.\n",
      "Vayentha fell through the darkness, bracing herself for the collision with the dusty floor\n",
      "that lay eight feet beneath the platform. Strangely, though, her landing was softer than\n",
      "she’d imagined … as if she had been caught by a cloth hammock, which now sagged\n",
      "beneath her weight.\n",
      "Disoriented, Vayentha lay on her back and stared up at her attacker. Sienna Brooks\n",
      "was looking down at her over the railing. Stunned, Vayentha opened her mouth to speak,\n",

      "The cloth that was supporting her weight tore open.\n",
      "Vayentha was falling again.\n",
      "This time she fell for three very long seconds, during which she found herself staring\n",
      "upward at a ceiling that was covered with beautiful paintings. The painting directly above\n",
      "her—a massive circular canvas depicting Cosimo I encircled by cherubs on a heavenly\n",
      "cloud—now showed a jagged dark tear that cut through its center.\n",
      "Then, with a sudden crash, Vayentha’s entire world vanished into blackness.\n",
      "High above, frozen in disbelief, Robert Langdon peered through the torn \n",

      " into\n",
      "the cavernous space below. On the stone floor of the Hall of the Five Hundred, the spike-\n",

      "lot of enemies by declaring that all doctors should stop practicing medicine because\n",
      "extending the human life span was only exacerbating the population problem.”\n",
      "Langdon now understood why the article spread wildly through the medical community.\n",
      "“Not surprisingly,” Sienna continued, “Zobrist was immediately attacked from all sides—\n",
      "politicians, clergy, the World Health Organization—all of whom derided him as a\n",
      "doomsayer lunatic who was simply trying to cause panic. They took particular umbrage at\n",
      "his statement that today’s youth, if they chose to reproduce, would have offspring that\n",
      "literally would witness the end of the human race. Zobrist illustrated his point with a\n",
      "‘Doomsday Clock,’ which showed that if the entire span of human life on earth were\n",
      "compressed into a single hour … we are now in its final seconds.”\n",
      "“I’ve actually seen that clock online,” Langdon said.\n",
      "“Yes, well, it’s his, and it caused quite an uproar. The biggest backlash against Zobrist,\n",
      "however, came when he declared that his advances in genetic engineering would be far\n",
      "more helpful to mankind if they were used not to \n",
      "cure\n",
      " disease, but rather to \n",
      "create\n",
      " it.”\n",
      "“What?!”\n",
      "“Yes, he argued that his technology should be used to limit population growth by\n",
      "creating hybrid strains of disease that our modern medicine would be unable to cure.”\n",
      "Langdon felt a rising dread as his mind conjured images of strange, hybrid “designer\n",
      "viruses” that, once released, were totally unstoppable.\n",
      "“Over a few short years,” Sienna said, “Zobrist went from being the toast of the\n",
      "medical world to being a total outcast. An anathema.” She paused, a look of compassion\n",
      "crossing her face. “It’s really no wonder he snapped and killed himself. Even sadder\n",
      "because his thesis is probably correct.”\n",
      "Langdon almost fell over. “I’m sorry—you think he’s \n",
      "right\n",
      "?!”\n",
      "Sienna gave him a solemn shrug. “Robert, speaking from a purely scientific standpoint\n",
      "—all logic, no heart—I can tell you without a doubt that without some kind of drastic\n",
      "change, the end of our species is coming. And it’s coming fast. It won’t be fire, brimstone,\n",
      "apocalypse, or nuclear war … it will be total collapse due to the number of people on the\n",
      "planet. The mathematics is indisputable.”\n",
      "Langdon stiffened.\n",
      "“I’ve studied a fair amount of biology,” she said, “and it’s quite normal for a species to\n",
      "go extinct simply as a result of overpopulating its environment. Picture a colony of surface\n",
      "algae living in a tiny pond in the forest, enjoying the pond’s perfect balance of nutrients.\n",
      "Unchecked, they reproduce so wildly that they quickly cover the pond’s entire surface,\n",
      "blotting out the sun and thereby preventing the growth of the nutrients in the pond.\n",
      "Having sapped everything possible from their environment, the algae quickly die and\n",
      "disappear without a trace.” She gave a heavy sigh. “A similar fate could easily await\n",
      "mankind. Far sooner and faster than any of us imagine.”\n",
      "Langdon felt deeply unsettled. “But … that seems impossible.”\n",
      "“Not impossible, Robert, just \n",
      "unthinkable\n",
      ". The human mind has a primitive ego defense\n",
      "mechanism that negates all realities that produce too much stress for the brain to handle.\n",
      "It’s called \n",
      "denial\n",
      ".”“I’ve heard of denial,” Langdon quipped blithely, “but I don’t think it exists.”\n",
      "Sienna rolled her eyes. “Cute, but believe me, it’s very real. Denial is a critical part of\n",
      "the human coping mechanism. Without it, we would all wake up terrified every morning\n",
      "about all the ways we could die. Instead, our minds block out our existential fears by\n",
      "focusing on stresses we can handle—like getting to work on time or paying our taxes. If\n",
      "we have wider, existential fears, we jettison them very quickly, refocusing on simple\n",
      "tasks and daily trivialities.”\n",
      "Langdon recalled a recent Web-tracking study of students at some Ivy League\n",
      "universities which revealed that even highly intellectual users \n",
      "displayed an instinctual\n",
      "tendency toward denial. According to the study, the vast majority of university students,\n",
      "after clicking on a depressing news article about arctic ice melt or species extinction,\n",
      "would quickly exit that page in favor of something trivial that purged their minds of fear;\n",
      "favorite choices included sports highlights, funny cat videos, and celebrity gossip.\n",
      "“In ancient mythology,” Langdon offered, “a hero in \n",
      "denial\n",
      " is the ultimate manifestation\n",
      "of hubris and pride. No man is more prideful than he who believes himself immune to the\n",
      "dangers of the world. Dante clearly agreed, denouncing pride as the \n",
      "worst\n",
      " of the seven\n",
      "deadly sins … and punished the prideful in the deepest ring of the inferno.”\n",
      "Sienna reflected a moment and then continued. “Zobrist’s article accused many of the\n",
      "world’s leaders of being in extreme denial … putting their heads in the sand. He was\n",
      "particularly critical of the World Health Organization.”\n",
      "“I bet that went over well.”\n",
      "“They reacted by equating him with a religious zealot on a street corner holding a sign\n",
      "that says ‘The End Is Near.’ ”\n",
      "“Harvard Square has a couple of those.”\n",
      "“Yes, and we all ignore them because none of us can imagine it will happen. But\n",
      "believe me, just because the human mind can’t \n",
      "imagine\n",
      " something happening … doesn’t\n",
      "mean it won’t.”\n",
      "“You almost sound like you’re a fan of Zobrist’s.”\n",
      "“I’m a fan of the \n",
      "truth\n",
      ",” she replied forcefully, “even if it’s painfully hard to accept.”\n",
      "Langdon fell silent, again feeling strangely isolated from Sienna at the moment, trying\n",
      "to understand her bizarre combination of passion and detachment.\n",
      "Sienna glanced over at him, her face softening. “Robert, look, I’m not saying Zobrist is\n",
      "correct that a plague that kills half the world’s people is the answer to overpopulation.\n",
      "Nor am I saying we should stop curing the sick. What I am saying is that our current path\n",
      "is a pretty simple formula for destruction. Population growth is an exponential\n",
      "progression occurring within a system of finite space and limited resources. The end will\n",
      "arrive very abruptly. Our experience will not be that of slowly running out of gas … it will\n",
      "be more like driving off a cliff.”\n",
      "Langdon exhaled, trying to process everything he had just heard.\n",
      "“Speaking of which,” she added, somberly pointing up in the air to their right, “I’m\n",
      "pretty sure that’s where Zobrist jumped.”\n",
      "Langdon glanced up and saw that they were just passing the austere \n",
      "stone facade of\n",
      "the Bargello Museum to their right. Behind it, the tapered spire of the Badia tower roseabove the surrounding structures. He stared at the top of the tower, wondering why\n",
      "Zobrist had jumped and hoped to hell it wasn’t because the man had done something\n",
      "terrible and hadn’t wanted to face what was coming.\n",
      "“Critics of Zobrist,” Sienna said, “like to point out how paradoxical it is that many of the\n",
      "genetic technologies he developed are now extending life expectancy dramatically.”\n",
      "“Which only compounds the population problem.”\n",
      "“Exactly. Zobrist once said publicly that he wished he could put the genie back in the\n",
      "bottle and erase some of his contributions to human longevity. I suppose that makes\n",
      "sense ideologically. The longer we live, the more our resources go to supporting the\n",
      "elderly and ailing.”\n",
      "Langdon nodded. “I’ve read that in the U.S. some sixty percent of health care costs go\n",
      "to support patients during the last six months of their lives.”\n",
      "“True, and while our brains say, ‘This is insane,’ our hearts say, ‘Keep Grandma alive as\n",
      "long as we can.’ ”\n",
      "Langdon nodded. “It’s the conflict between Apollo and Dionysus—a famous dilemma in\n",
      "mythology. It’s the age-old battle between mind and heart, which seldom want the same\n",
      "thing.”\n",
      "The mythological reference, Langdon had heard, was now being used in AA meetings\n",
      "to describe the alcoholic who stares at a glass of alcohol, his brain knowing it will harm\n",
      "him, but his heart craving the comfort it will provide. The message apparently was: Don’t\n",
      "feel alone—even the gods were conflicted.\n",
      "“Who needs agathusia?” Sienna whispered suddenly.\n",
      "“I’m sorry?”\n",
      "Sienna glanced up. “I finally remembered the name of Zobrist’s essay. It was called:\n",
      "‘Who Needs Agathusia?’ ”\n",
      "Langdon had never heard the word \n",
      "agathusia\n",
      ", but took his best guess based on its\n",
      "Greek roots—\n",
      "agathos\n",
      " and \n",
      "thusia\n",
      ". “Agathusia … would be a ‘good sacrifice’?”\n",
      "“Almost. Its actual meaning is ‘a self-sacrifice for the common good.’ ” She paused.\n",
      "“Otherwise known as benevolent suicide.”\n",
      "Langdon had indeed heard this term before—once in relation to a bankrupt father who\n",
      "killed himself so his family could collect his life insurance, and a second time to describe a\n",
      "remorseful serial killer who ended his life fearing he couldn’t control his impulse to kill.\n",
      "The most chilling example Langdon recalled, however, was in the \n",
      "1967 novel \n",
      "Logan’s\n",
      "Run\n",
      ", which depicted a future society in which everyone gladly agreed to commit suicide\n",
      "at age twenty-one—thus fully enjoying their youth while not letting their numbers or old\n",
      "age stress the planet’s limited resources. If Langdon recalled correctly, the movie version\n",
      "of \n",
      "Logan’s Run\n",
      " had increased the “termination age” from twenty-one to thirty, no doubt in\n",
      "an attempt to make the film more palatable to the box office’s crucial eighteen-to-\n",
      "twenty-five demographic.\n",
      "“So, Zobrist’s essay …” Langdon said. “I’m not sure I understand the title. ‘Who Needs\n",
      "Agathusia?’ Was he saying it sarcastically? As in who needs benevolent suicide … we \n",
      "all\n",
      "do?”\n",
      "“Actually no, the title is a pun.”Langdon shook his head, not seeing it.\n",
      "“\n",
      "Who\n",
      " needs suicide—as in the \n",
      "W-H-O\n",
      "—the World Health Organization. In his essay,\n",
      "Zobrist railed against the director of the WHO—Dr. Elizabeth Sinskey—who has been\n",
      "there forever and, according to Zobrist, is not taking population control seriously. His\n",
      "article was saying that the WHO would be better off if Director Sinskey killed herself.”\n",
      "“Compassionate guy.”\n",
      "“The perils of being a genius, I guess. Oftentimes, those special brains, the ones that\n",
      "are capable of focusing more intently than others, do so at the expense of emotional\n",
      "maturity.”\n",
      "Langdon pictured the articles he had seen about the young Sienna, the child prodigy\n",
      "with the 208 IQ and off-the-chart intellectual function. Langdon wondered if, in talking\n",
      "about Zobrist, she was also, on some level, talking about herself; he also wondered how\n",
      "long she would choose to keep her secret.\n",
      "Up ahead, Langdon spotted the landmark he had been looking for. After crossing the\n",
      "Via dei Leoni, Langdon led her to the intersection of an exceptionally narrow street—\n",
      "more of an alleyway. The sign overhead read \n",
      "VIA DANTE ALIGHIERI\n",
      ".\n",
      "“It sounds like you know a lot about the human brain,” Langdon said. “Was that your\n",
      "area of concentration in medical school?”\n",
      "“No, but when I was a kid, I read a lot. I became interested in brain science because I\n",
      "had some … medical issues.”\n",
      "Langdon shot her a curious look, hoping she would continue.\n",
      "“My brain …” Sienna said quietly. “It grew differently from most kids’, and it caused\n",
      "some … problems. I spent a lot of time trying to figure out what was wrong with me, and\n",
      "in the process I learned a lot about neuroscience.” She caught Langdon’s eye. “And yes,\n",
      "my baldness is related to my medical condition.”\n",
      "Langdon averted his eyes, embarrassed he’d asked.\n",
      "“Don’t worry about it,” she said. “I’ve learned to live with it.”\n",
      "As they moved into the cold air of the shadowed alleyway, Langdon considered\n",
      "everything he had just learned about Zobrist and his alarming philosophical positions.\n",
      "A recurring question nagged at him. “These soldiers,” Langdon began. “The ones trying\n",
      "to kill us. Who are they? It makes no sense. If Zobrist has put a potential plague out\n",
      "there, wouldn’t everyone be on the same side, working to stop its release?”\n",
      "“Not necessarily. Zobrist may be a pariah in the medical community, but he probably\n",
      "has a legion of devout fans of his ideology—people who agree that a culling is a\n",
      "necessary evil to save the planet. For all we know, these soldiers are trying to ensure\n",
      "that Zobrist’s vision is realized.”\n",
      "Zobrist’s own private army of disciples?\n",
      " Langdon considered the possibility. Admittedly,\n",
      "history was full of zealots and cults who killed themselves because of all kinds of crazy\n",
      "notions—a belief that their leader is the Messiah, a belief that a spaceship is waiting for\n",
      "them behind the moon, a belief that Judgment Day is imminent. The speculation about\n",
      "population control was at least grounded in science, and yet something about these\n",
      "soldiers still didn’t feel right to Langdon.\n",
      "“I just can’t believe that a bunch of trained soldiers would knowingly agree to killinnocent masses … all the while fearing they might get sick and die themselves.”\n",
      "Sienna shot him a puzzled look. “Robert, what do you think soldiers \n",
      "do\n",
      " when they go to\n",
      "war? They kill innocent people and risk their own death. Anything is possible when people\n",
      "believe in a cause.”\n",
      "“A cause? Releasing a plague?”\n",
      "Sienna glanced at him, her brown eyes probing. “Robert, the \n",
      "cause\n",
      " is not releasing a\n",
      "plague … it’s saving the world.” She paused. “One of the passages in Bertrand Zobrist’s\n",
      "essay that got a lot of people talking was a very pointed hypothetical question. I want\n",
      "you to answer it.”\n",
      "“What’s the question?”\n",
      "“Zobrist asked the following: If you could throw a switch and randomly kill half the\n",

      "didn’t\n",
      " throw that switch right now, the\n",

      "destination for devotees of Dante who revere it as the sacred ground on which transpired\n",
      "two pivotal moments in the great poet’s life.\n",
      "According to lore, it was here at this church, at the age of nine, that Dante first laid\n",
      "eyes on Beatrice Portinari—the woman with whom he fell in love at first sight, and for\n",
      "whom his heart ached his entire life. To Dante’s great anguish, Beatrice married another\n",
      "man, and then died at the youthful age of twenty-four.\n",
      "It was also in this church, some years later, that Dante married Gemma Donati—a\n",
      "woman who, even by the account of the great writer and poet Boccaccio, was a poor\n",
      "choice of wife for Dante. Despite having children, the couple showed little signs of\n",
      "affection for each other, and after Dante’s exile, neither spouse seemed eager to see the\n",
      "other ever again.\n",
      "The love of Dante’s life had always been and would always remain the departed\n",
      "Beatrice Portinari, whom Dante had scarcely known, and yet whose memory was so\n",

      "Langdon was relieved once again to feel like himself.\n",
      "As they strode into an even tighter alleyway—the Via del Presto—Langdon scanned the\n",
      "various doorways. The entrance of the church was always tricky to locate because the\n",
      "building itself was very small, unadorned, and wedged tightly between two other\n",
      "buildings. One could easily walk past it without even noticing. Oddly, it was often easier\n",

      "ears\n",
      ".One of the peculiarities of La Chiesa di Santa Margherita dei Cerchi was that it hosted\n",
      "frequent concerts, and when no concert was scheduled, the church piped in recordings of\n",
      "those concerts so visitors could enjoy the music at any time.\n",
      "As anticipated, as they advanced down the alleyway, Langdon began to hear the thin\n",
      "strains of recorded music, which grew steadily louder, until he and Sienna were standing\n",
      "before the inconspicuous entrance. The only indication that this was indeed the correct\n",
      "location was a tiny sign—the antithesis of the bright red banner at the Museo Casa di\n",
      "Dante—that humbly announced that this was the church of Dante and Beatrice.\n",
      "When Langdon and Sienna stepped off the street into the dark confines of the church,\n",
      "the air grew cooler and the music grew louder. The interior was stark and simple …\n",
      "smaller than Langdon recalled. There was only a handful of tourists, mingling, writing in\n",
      "journals, sitting quietly in the pews enjoying the music, or examining the curious\n",
      "collection of artwork.\n",
      "With the exception of the Madonna-themed altarpiece by Neri di Bicci, almost all of the\n",
      "original art in this chapel had been replaced with contemporary pieces representing the\n",
      "two celebrities—Dante and Beatrice—the reasons most visitors sought out this tiny\n",
      "chapel. Most of the paintings depicted Dante’s longing gaze during his famous first\n",
      "encounter with Beatrice, during which the poet, by his own account, instantly fell in love.\n",
      "The paintings were of widely varying quality, and most, to Langdon’s taste, seemed\n",
      "kitschy and out of place. In one such rendering, Dante’s iconic red cap with earflaps\n",
      "looked like something \n",
      "Dante had stolen from Santa Claus. Nonetheless, the recurring\n",
      "theme of the poet’s yearning gaze at his muse, Beatrice, left no doubt that this was a\n",
      "church of painful love—unfulfilled, unrequited, and unattained.\n",
      "Langdon turned instinctively to his left and gazed upon the modest tomb of Beatrice\n",
      "Portinari. This was the primary reason people visited this church, although not so much to\n",
      "see the tomb itself as to see the famous object that sat beside it.\n",
      "A wicker basket.\n",
      "This morning, as always, the simple wicker basket sat beside Beatrice’s tomb. And this\n",
      "morning, as always, it was overflowing with folded slips of paper—each a handwritten\n",
      "letter from a visitor, written to Beatrice herself.\n",
      "Beatrice Portinari had become something of a patron saint of star-crossed lovers, and\n",
      "according to long-standing tradition, handwritten prayers to Beatrice could be deposited\n",
      "in the basket in the hope that she would intervene on the writer’s behalf—perhaps\n",
      "inspiring someone to love them more, or helping them find their true love, or even giving\n",
      "them the strength to forget a love who had passed away.\n",
      "Langdon, many years ago, while in the throes of researching a book on art history, had\n",
      "paused in this church to leave a note in the basket, entreating Dante’s muse not to grant\n",
      "him true love, but to shed on him some of the inspiration that had enabled Dante to write\n",
      "his massive tome.\n",
      "Sing in me, Muse, and through me tell the story …\n",
      "The opening line of Homer’s \n",
      "Odyssey\n",
      " had seemed a worthy supplication, and Langdon\n",
      "secretly believed his message had indeed sparked Beatrice’s divine inspiration, for upon\n",
      "his return home, he had written the book with unusual ease.“Scusate!”\n",
      " Sienna’s voice boomed suddenly. \n",
      "“Potete ascoltarmi tutti?” Everyone?\n",
      "Langdon spun to see Sienna loudly addressing the scattering of tourists, all of whom\n",
      "now glanced over at her, looking somewhat alarmed.\n",
      "Sienna smiled sweetly at everyone and asked in Italian if anyone happened to have a\n",
      "copy of Dante’s \n",
      "Divine Comedy\n",
      ". After some strange looks and shakes of the head, she\n",
      "tried the question in English, without any more success.\n",
      "An older woman who was sweeping the altar hissed sharply at Sienna and held up a\n",
      "finger to her lips for silence.\n",
      "Sienna turned back to Langdon and frowned, as if to say, “Now what?”\n",
      "Sienna’s calling-all-cars solicitation was not quite what Langdon had \n",
      "had in mind, but\n",
      "he had to admit he’d anticipated a better response than she’d received. On previous\n",

      "The Divine Comedy\n",
      " in this\n",
      "hallowed space, apparently enjoying a total immersion in the Dante experience.\n",
      "Not so today.\n",
      "Langdon set his sights on an elderly couple seated near the front of the church. The old\n",
      "man’s bald head was dipped forward, chin to chest; clearly he was stealing a nap. The\n",
      "woman beside him seemed very much awake, with a pair of white earbud cables dangling\n",
      "from beneath her gray hair.\n",
      "A glimmer of promise\n",

      "with the couple. As Langdon had hoped, the woman’s telltale white earbuds snaked down\n",
      "to an iPhone in her lap. Sensing she was being watched, she looked up and pulled the\n",
      "earbuds from her ears.\n",
      "Langdon had no idea what language the woman spoke, but the global proliferation of\n",
      "iPhones, iPads, and iPods had resulted in a vocabulary as universally understood as the\n",
      "male/female symbols that graced restrooms around the world.\n",
      "“iPhone?” Langdon asked, admiring her device.\n",
      "The old woman brightened at once, nodding proudly. “Such a clever little toy,” she\n",
      "whispered in a British accent. “My son got it for me. I’m listening to my e-mail. Can you\n",
      "believe it—\n",
      "listening\n",
      " to my e-mail? This little treasure actually \n",

      "eyes, it’s such a help.”\n",
      "“I have one, too,” Langdon said with a smile as he sat down beside her, careful not to\n",
      "wake up her sleeping husband. “But somehow I lost it last night.”\n",
      "“Oh, tragedy! Did you try the ‘find your iPhone’ feature? My son says—”\n",
      "“Stupid me, I never activated that feature.” Langdon gave her a sheepish look and\n",
      "ventured hesitantly, “If it’s not too much of an intrusion, would you mind terribly if I\n",
      "borrowed yours for just a moment? I need to look up something online. It would be a big\n",
      "help to me.”\n",
      "“Of course!” She pulled out the earbuds and thrust the device into his hands. “No\n",
      "problem at all! Poor dear.”\n",
      "Langdon thanked her and took the phone. While she prattled on beside him about how\n",
      "terrible she would feel if she lost her iPhone, Langdon pulled up Google’s search window\n",
      "and pressed the microphone button. When the phone beeped once, Langdon articulated\n",
      "his search string.“Dante, \n",
      "Divine Comedy\n",
      ", \n",
      "Paradise\n",

      "The woman looked amazed, apparently having yet to learn about this feature. As the\n",
      "search results began to materialize on the tiny screen, Langdon stole a quick glance back\n",
      "at Sienna, who was thumbing through some printed material near the basket of letters to\n",
      "Beatrice.\n",
      "Not far from where Sienna stood, a man in a necktie was kneeling in the shadows,\n",
      "praying intently, his head bowed low. Langdon couldn’t see his face, but he felt a pang of\n",
      "sadness for the solitary man, who had probably lost his loved one and had come here for\n",
      "comfort.\n",
      "Langdon returned his focus to the iPhone, and within seconds was able to pull up a link\n",
      "to a digital offering of \n",
      "The Divine Comedy—\n",
      " freely accessible because it was in the public\n",
      "domain. When the page opened precisely to Canto 25, he had to admit he was impressed\n",

      "the high data rates for surfing the Internet abroad, Langdon sensed that his window of\n",
      "opportunity would be brief, and he focused intently on the Web page before him.\n",
      "The text was small, but the dim lighting in the chapel made the illuminated screen\n",
      "more legible. Langdon was pleased to see he had randomly stumbled into the\n",
      "Mandelbaum translation—a popular modern rendition by the late American professor\n",

      "Today I’ll take clarity over poesy\n",

      "death mask.\n",

      "began to read, he recalled the passage. In the opening of Canto 25, Dante referenced\n",

      " itself, the physical toll its writing had taken on him, and the aching\n",

      "While the passage was a reminder that fair Florence was the home for which Dante\n",

      "Langdon assured her he would be only a minute and offered to reimburse her, but even\n",
      "so, he sensed she would never let him read all one hundred lines of Canto 25.\n",

      "for that faith, Peter garlanded my brow.\n",

      "man but the laurel crown of a poet.\n",
      "Langdon raised his index finger to scroll farther, but the woman suddenly protested,\n",
      "holding out her hand for the iPhone, apparently having reconsidered her loan.\n",
      "Langdon barely heard her. In the split second before he had touched the screen, his\n",

      "at my baptismal font, the laurel crown;\n",

      "at my baptismal font …\n",
      "Florence was home to one of the world’s most celebrated baptismal fonts, which for\n",
      "more than seven hundred years had been used to purify and christen young Florentines—\n",
      "among them, Dante Alighieri.\n",
      "Langdon immediately conjured an image of the building containing the font. It was a\n",
      "spectacular, octagonal edifice that in many ways was more heavenly than the Duomo\n",
      "itself. He now wondered if perhaps he’d read all he needed to read.\n",
      "Could this building be the place Ignazio was referring to?\n",
      "A ray of golden light blazed now in Langdon’s mind as a beautiful image materialized—\n",

      "nearly equal to that of the Washington Monument laid on its side.\n",
      "Despite its abandonment of traditional monochromatic stone filigree in favor of an\n",
      "unusually flamboyant mix of colors, the structure was pure Gothic—classic, robust, and\n",
      "enduring. Admittedly, Langdon, on his first trip to Florence, had found the architecture\n",
      "almost gaudy. On subsequent trips, however, he found himself studying the structure for\n",

      "ascend the dome only to discover that its narrow, tourist-crammed staircases were as\n",
      "distressing as any of the claustrophobic spaces he’d ever encountered. Even so, Langdon\n",

      "Continuing quickly around the base of Giotto’s bell tower, Langdon and Sienna turned\n",
      "right, moving out across the open square directly in front of the cathedral. Here the\n",
      "crowds were thickest, with tourists from around the world aiming camera phones and\n",
      "video cameras upward at the colorful main facade.\n",
      "Langdon barely glanced up, having already set his sights on a much smaller building\n",
      "that had just come into view. Positioned directly opposite the front entrance of the\n",
      "cathedral stood the third and final structure in the cathedral complex.\n",
      "It was also Langdon’s favorite.\n",
      "The Baptistry of San Giovanni.\n",
      "Adorned in the same polychromatic facing stones and striped pilasters as the cathedral,\n",
      "the baptistry distinguished itself from the larger building by its striking shape—a perfect\n",
      "octagon. Resembling a layer cake, some had claimed, the eight-sided structure consisted\n",
      "of three distinct tiers that ascended to a shallow white roof.\n",
      "Langdon knew the octagonal shape had nothing to do with aesthetics and everything to\n",
      "do with symbolism. In Christianity, the number eight represented rebirth and re-creation.\n",
      "The octagon served as a visual reminder of the six days of God’s creation of heaven and\n",
      "earth, the one day of Sabbath, and the eighth day, upon which Christians were “reborn”\n",
      "or “re-created” through baptism. Octagons had become a common shape for baptistries\n",
      "around the world.While Langdon considered the baptistry one of Florence’s most striking buildings, he\n",
      "always found the choice of its location a bit unfair. This baptistry, nearly anywhere else\n",
      "on earth, would be the center of attention. Here, however, in the shadow of its two\n",
      "colossal siblings, the baptistry gave the impression of being the runt of the litter.\n",

      "hundred years ago had stared down at the young Dante Alighieri, terrifying him and\n",
      "eventually inspiring his vivid portrayal of what lurked in the final ring of hell.\n",
      "The frightening mosaic overhead depicted a horned devil that was in the process of\n",
      "consuming a human being headfirst. The victim’s legs dangled from Satan’s mouth in a\n",
      "way that resembled the flailing legs of the half-buried sinners in Dante’s Malebolge.\n",

      "of the despondent kingdom.\n",
      "Slithering from the ears of Satan were two massive, writhing snakes, also in the\n",

      "as Dante described him in the final canto of his \n",

      "On his head he had three faces … his three chins gushing a bloody froth … his three\n",
      "mouths used as grinders … gnashing sinners three at once.That Satan’s evil was threefold, Langdon knew, was fraught with symbolic meaning: it\n",
      "placed him in perfect balance with the threefold glory of the Holy Trinity.\n",

      "on the youthful Dante, who had attended services at this church year after year, and seen\n",
      "Satan staring down at him each time he prayed. This morning, however, Langdon had the\n",
      "uneasy feeling that the devil was staring directly at \n",
      "him\n",
      ".\n",
      "He quickly lowered his gaze to the baptistry’s second-story balcony and standing\n",

      "and resembled nothing so much as a large, patched-up hole, which, in fact, was precisely\n",
      "what it was.\n",
      "Langdon quickly explained that the baptistry’s original baptismal font had been a large\n",
      "octagonal pool located at the very center of this room. While modern fonts were usually\n",
      "raised basins, earlier fonts were more akin to the literal meaning of the word\n",
      "font\n",

      "pool of icy water that once stood in the middle of the floor.\n",
      "“Baptisms here were cold and scary,” Langdon said. “True rites of passage. Dangerous\n",
      "even. Allegedly Dante once jumped into the font to save a drowning child. In any case,\n",
      "the original font was covered over at some point in the sixteenth century.”\n",

      "Nonetheless, Langdon felt remarkably confident as he turned and faced the door\n",
      "through which they’d just entered. “We should start over there,” he said, pointing to an\n",

      "Langdon crouched lower, peering more closely at the scene before him. The font was\n",
      "several feet deep—more of a vertical well than a shallow basin—its steep walls dropping\n",
      "down to a hexagonal repository that was filled with water. Strangely, the mask seemed\n",
      "to be suspended partway down the font … perched just above the surface of the water as\n",
      "if by magic.\n",
      "It took a moment for Langdon to realize what was causing the illusion. The font had a\n",
      "vertical central spindle that rose halfway up and flattened into a kind of small metal\n",
      "platter just above the water. The platter appeared to be a decorative fountainhead and\n",
      "perhaps a place to rest a baby’s bottom, but it was currently serving as a pedestal on\n",
      "which the mask of Dante rested, elevated safely above the water.\n",
      "Neither Langdon nor Sienna said a word as they stood side by side gazing down at the\n",
      "craggy face of Dante Alighieri, still sealed in his Ziploc bag, as if he’d been suffocated. For\n",
      "a moment the image of a face staring up out of a water-filled basin conjured for Langdon\n",
      "his own terrifying experience as a child, stuck at the bottom of a well, staring skyward in\n",
      "desperation.\n",
      "Pushing the thought from his mind, he carefully reached down and gripped the mask on\n",
      "either side, where Dante’s ears would have been. Although the face was small by modern\n",
      "standards, the ancient plaster \n",
      "was heavier than he’d expected. He slowly lifted the mask\n",
      "out of the font and held it up so that he and Sienna could examine it more closely.\n",
      "Even viewed through the plastic bag, the mask was remarkably lifelike. Every wrinkle\n",
      "and blemish of the old poet’s face had been captured by the wet plaster. With the\n",
      "exception of an old crack down the center of the mask, it was in perfect condition.\n",
      "“Turn it over,” Sienna whispered. “Let’s see the back.”\n",
      "Langdon was already doing just that. The security video from the Palazzo Vecchio had\n",
      "clearly shown Langdon and Ignazio discovering something on the reverse side of the\n",
      "mask—something of such startling interest that the two men had essentially walked out\n",
      "of the palace with the artifact.\n",
      "Taking exceptional care not to drop the fragile plaster, Langdon flipped the mask over\n",
      "and laid it facedown in his right palm so they could examine the back. Unlike the\n",
      "weathered, textured face of Dante, the inside of the mask was smooth and bare. Becausethe mask was never meant to be worn, its back side had been filled in with plaster to\n",
      "give some solidity to the delicate piece, resulting in a featureless, concave surface, like a\n",
      "shallow soup bowl.\n",
      "Langdon didn’t know what he had expected to find on the back of the mask, but it most\n",
      "certainly was not this.\n",
      "Nothing.\n",
      "Nothing at all.\n",
      "Just a smooth, empty surface.\n",
      "Sienna seemed equally confused. “It’s blank plaster,” she whispered. “If there’s nothing\n",
      "here, what did you and Ignazio see?”\n",
      "I have no idea\n",
      ", Langdon thought, pulling the plastic bag taut across the plaster for a\n",
      "clearer view. \n",
      "There’s nothing here!\n",
      " With mounting distress, Langdon raised the mask into\n",
      "a shaft of light and studied it closely. As he tipped the object over for a better view, he\n",
      "thought for an instant that he might have glimpsed a faint discoloration near the top—a\n",
      "line of markings running horizontally across the inside of Dante’s forehead.\n",
      "A natural blemish? Or maybe … something else.\n",
      " Langdon immediately spun and\n",
      "pointed to a hinged panel of marble on the wall behind them. “Look in there,” he told\n",
      "Sienna. “See if there are towels.”\n",
      "Sienna looked skeptical, but obeyed, opening the discreetly hidden cupboard, which\n",
      "contained three items—a valve for controlling the water level in the font, a light switch\n",
      "for controlling the spotlight above the font, and … a stack of linen towels.\n",
      "Sienna gave Langdon a surprised look, but Langdon had toured enough churches\n",
      "worldwide to know that baptismal fonts almost always afforded their priests easy access\n",
      "to emergency \n",
      "swaddling cloths\n",
      "—the unpredictability of infants’ bladders a universal risk of\n",
      "christenings.\n",
      "“Good,” he said, eyeing the towels. “Hold the mask a second?” He gently transferred\n",
      "the mask to Sienna’s hands and then set to work.\n",
      "First, Langdon retrieved the hexagonal lid and heaved it back up onto the font to\n",
      "restore the small, altarlike table they had first seen. Then he grabbed several of the linen\n",
      "towels from the cupboard and spread them out like a tablecloth. Finally, he flipped the\n",
      "font’s light switch, and the spotlight directly overhead sprang to life, illuminating the\n",
      "baptismal area and shining brightly down on the covered surface.\n",
      "Sienna gently laid the mask on the font while Langdon retrieved more towels, which he\n",
      "used like oven mitts to slide the mask from the Ziploc bag, careful not to touch it with his\n",
      "bare hands. Moments later, Dante’s death mask lay unsheathed and naked, faceup\n",
      "beneath the bright light, like the head of an anesthetized patient on an operating table.\n",
      "The mask’s dramatic texturing appeared even more unsettling in the light, the creases\n",
      "and wrinkles of old age accentuated by the discolored plaster. Langdon wasted no time\n",
      "using his makeshift mitts to flip the mask over and lay it facedown.\n",
      "The back side of the mask looked markedly less aged than the front—clean and white\n",
      "rather than dingy and yellow.\n",
      "Sienna cocked her head, looking puzzled. “Does this side look \n",
      "newer\n",
      " to you?”\n",
      "Admittedly, the color difference was more emphatic than Langdon would haveimagined, but this side was most certainly the same age as the front. “Uneven aging,” he\n",
      "said. “The back of the mask has been shielded by the display case so has never suffered\n",
      "the aging effects of sunlight.” Langdon made a mental note to double the SPF of his\n",
      "sunscreen.\n",
      "“Hold on,” Sienna said, leaning in close to the mask. “Look! On the forehead! That\n",
      "must be what you and Ignazio saw.”\n",
      "Langdon’s eyes moved quickly across the smooth white surface to the same\n",
      "discoloration he had spied earlier through the plastic—a faint line of markings that ran\n",
      "horizontally across the inside of Dante’s forehead. Now, however, in the stark light,\n",
      "Langdon saw clearly that these markings were not a natural blemish … they were man-\n",
      "made.\n",
      "“It’s … writing,” Sienna whispered, the words catching in her throat. “But …”\n",
      "Langdon studied the inscription on the plaster. It was a single row of letters—\n",
      "handwritten in a florid script of faint brownish yellow.\n",
      "“That’s \n",
      "all\n",
      " it says?” Sienna said, sounding almost angry.\n",
      "Langdon barely heard her. \n",
      "Who wrote this?\n",
      " he wondered. \n",
      "Someone in Dante’s era?\n",
      " It\n",
      "seemed unlikely. If so, some art historian would have spotted it long ago during regular\n",
      "cleaning or restoration, and the writing would have become part of the lore of the mask.\n",
      "Langdon had never heard of it.\n",
      "A far more likely source quickly materialized in his mind.\n",
      "Bertrand Zobrist.\n",
      "Zobrist was the mask’s owner and therefore could easily have requested private access\n",
      "to it whenever he wanted. He could have written the text on the back of the mask fairly\n",
      "recently and then replaced it in the antique case without anyone ever knowing. \n",

      "Sienna seemed to accept his logic, and yet the prospect clearly troubled her. “It makes\n",
      "no sense,” she said, looking restless. “If we believe Zobrist secretly wrote something on\n",
      "the back of the Dante death mask, and he also went to the trouble to create that little\n",
      "projector to point to the mask … then why didn’t he write something more \n",

      "what he and Sienna were to do next.\n",
      "Furthermore, he had detected a faint odor to the mask—a familiar scent that divulged\n",

      "nothing to do with aging or sunlight.“I don’t understand,” Sienna said. “The letters are all the same.”\n",

      "It didn’t seem to make much sense.\n",
      "“There’s got to be more,” Sienna contended, taking the mask from Langdon’s hands\n",
      "and studying it more closely. After a moment she began nodding. “Yes, look at the ends\n",
      "of the word … there’s more text on either side.”\n",
      "Langdon looked again, now seeing the faint shadow of additional text showing through\n",
      "the moist gesso at either end of the word \n",
      "possessed\n",
      ".\n",
      "Eagerly, Sienna grabbed the cloth and continued dabbing around the word until more\n",
      "text materialized, written on a gentle curve.\n",
      "O you possessed of sturdy intellect\n",
      "Langdon let out a low whistle. \n",
      "“ ‘O, you possessed of sturdy intellect … observe the\n",
      "teachings hidden here … beneath the veil of verses so obscure.’ ”\n",
      "Sienna stared at him. “I’m sorry?”\n",
      "“It’s taken from one of the most famous stanzas of Dante’s \n",
      "Inferno\n",
      ",” Langdon said\n",
      "excitedly. “It’s Dante urging his smartest readers to seek the wisdom hidden within his\n",
      "cryptic verse.”\n",
      "Langdon often cited this exact line when teaching literary symbolism; the line was as\n",
      "close an example as existed to an author waving his arms \n",
      "wildly and shouting: “Hey,\n",
      "readers! There is a symbolic double meaning here!”\n",
      "Sienna began rubbing the back of the mask, more vigorously now.\n",
      "“Careful with that!” Langdon urged.\n",
      "“You’re right,” Sienna announced, zealously wiping away gesso. “The rest of Dante’s\n",
      "quote is here—just as you recalled it.” She paused to dip the cloth back in the font and\n",
      "rinse it out.\n",
      "Langdon looked on in dismay as the water in the baptismal font turned cloudy with\n",
      "dissolved gesso. \n",
      "Our apologies to San Giovanni\n",
      ", he thought, uneasy that this sacred font\n",
      "was being used as a sink.\n",
      "When Sienna raised the cloth from the water, it was dripping. She barely wrung it out\n",
      "before placing the soggy cloth in the center of the mask and swishing it around as if she\n",
      "were cleaning a soup bowl.“Sienna!” Langdon admonished. “That’s an ancient—”\n",
      "“The \n",
      "whole\n",
      " back side has text!” she announced as she scoured the inside of the mask.\n",
      "“And it’s written in …” She paused, cocking her head to the left and rotating the mask to\n",
      "the right, as if trying to read sideways.\n",
      "“Written in what?” Langdon demanded, unable to see.\n",
      "Sienna finished cleaning the mask and dried it off with a fresh cloth. Then she set it\n",
      "down in front of him so they could both study the result.\n",
      "When Langdon saw the inside of the mask, he did a double take. The entire concave\n",
      "surface was covered in text, what had to be nearly a hundred words. Beginning at the top\n",
      "with the line \n",
      "O you possessed of sturdy intellect\n",
      ", the text continued in a single, unbroken\n",
      "line … curling down the right side of the mask to the bottom, where it turned upside\n",
      "down and continued back across the bottom, returning up the left side of the mask to the\n",
      "beginning, where it repeated a similar path in a slightly smaller loop.\n",
      "The path of the text was eerily reminiscent of Mount Purgatory’s spiraling pathway to\n",
      "paradise. The symbologist in Langdon instantly identified the precise spiral. \n",
      "Symmetrical\n",
      "clockwise Archimedean.\n",
      " He had also noted that the number of revolutions from the first\n",
      "word, \n",
      "O\n",
      ", to the final period in the center was a familiar number.\n",
      "Nine.\n",
      "Barely breathing, Langdon turned the mask in slow circles, reading the text as it curled\n",
      "ever inward around the concave bowl, funneling toward the center.\n",
      "“The first stanza is Dante, almost verbatim,” Langdon said. “ ‘O you possessed of\n",
      "sturdy intellect, observe the teaching that is hidden here … beneath the veil of verses so\n",
      "obscure.’ ”\n",
      "“And the rest?” Sienna pressed.Langdon shook his head. “I don’t think so. It’s written in a similar verse pattern, but I\n",
      "don’t recognize the text as Dante’s. It looks like someone is imitating his style.”\n",
      "“Zobrist,” Sienna whispered. “It \n",
      "has\n",
      " to be.”\n",
      "Langdon nodded. It was as good a guess as any. Zobrist, after all, by altering\n",
      "Botticelli’s \n",
      "Mappa dell’Inferno\n",
      ", had already revealed his proclivity for collaborating with\n",
      "the masters and modifying great works of art to suit his needs.\n",
      "“The rest of the text is very strange,” Langdon said, again rotating the \n",
      "mask and\n",
      "reading inward. “It talks about … severing the heads from horses … plucking up the bones\n",
      "of the blind.” He skimmed ahead to the final line, which was written in a tight circle at\n",
      "the very center of the mask. He drew a startled breath. “It also mentions ‘bloodred\n",
      "waters.’ ”\n",
      "Sienna’s eyebrows arched. “Just like your visions of the silver-haired woman?”\n",
      "Langdon nodded, puzzling over the text. \n",
      "The bloodred waters … of the lagoon that\n",
      "reflects no stars?\n",
      "“Look,” she whispered, reading over his shoulder and pointing to a single word partway\n",
      "through the spiral. “A specific location.”\n",
      "Langdon’s eyes found the word, which he had skimmed over on his first pass. It was\n",
      "the name of one of the most spectacular and unique cities in the world. Langdon felt a\n",
      "chill, knowing it also happened to be the city in which Dante Alighieri famously became\n",
      "infected with the deadly disease that killed him.\n",
      "Venice.\n",
      "Langdon and Sienna studied the cryptic verses in silence for several moments. The\n",
      "poem was disturbing and macabre, and hard to decipher. Use of the words \n",
      "doge\n",
      " and\n",
      "lagoon\n",
      " confirmed for Langdon beyond any doubt that the poem was indeed referencing\n",
      "Venice—a unique Italian water-world city made up of hundreds of interconnected lagoons\n",
      "and ruled for centuries by a Venetian head of state known as a doge.\n",
      "At a glance, Langdon could not discern exactly where in Venice this poem was pointing,\n",
      "but it definitely seemed to be urging the reader to follow its directions.\n",
      "Place thine ear to the ground, listening for the sounds of trickling water.\n",
      "“It’s pointing underground,” Sienna said, reading along with him.\n",
      "Langdon gave an uneasy nod as he read the next line.\n",
      "Follow deep into the sunken palace … for here, in the darkness, the chthonic monster\n",
      "waits.\n",
      "“Robert?” Sienna asked uneasily. “What kind of monster?”\n",
      "“Chthonic,” Langdon replied. “The \n",
      "c-h\n",
      " is silent. It means ‘dwelling beneath the earth.’ ”\n",
      "Before Langdon could continue, the loud clunk of a dead bolt echoed across the\n",
      "baptistry. The tourist entrance had apparently just been unlocked from outside.\n",
      "“Grazie mille,”\n",
      " said the man with the rash on his face. \n",
      "A thousand thanks.\n",
      "The baptistry docent nodded nervously as he pocketed the five hundred \n",
      "dollars cash\n",
      "and glanced around to make sure nobody was watching.\n",
      "“Cinque minuti,”\n",
      " the docent reminded, discreetly swinging open the unbolted door justwide enough for the man with the rash to slip inside. The docent closed the door, sealing\n",
      "the man inside and blocking out all sound from outside. \n",
      "Five minutes.\n",
      "Initially the docent had refused to take pity on the man who claimed to have come all\n",
      "the way from America to pray at the Baptistry of San Giovanni in hopes of curing his\n",
      "terrible skin disease. Eventually, though, he had been inspired to become sympathetic,\n",
      "aided no doubt by an offer of five hundred dollars for five minutes alone in the baptistry\n",
      "… combined with the growing fear that this contagious-looking person would stand there\n",
      "beside him for the next three hours until the building opened.\n",
      "Now, as he moved stealthily into the octagonal sanctuary, the man felt his eyes drawn\n",
      "reflexively upward. \n",
      "Holy shit.\n",
      " The ceiling was like nothing he’d ever seen. A three-headed\n",
      "demon stared down directly at him, and he quickly lowered his gaze to the floor.\n",
      "The space appeared to be deserted.\n",
      "Where the hell are they?\n",
      "As the man scanned the room, his eyes fell on the main altar. It was a massive\n",
      "rectangular block of marble, set back in a niche, behind a barrier of stanchions and swags\n",
      "to keep spectators away.\n",
      "The altar appeared to be the only hiding place in the entire room. Moreover, one of the\n",
      "swags was swinging slightly … as if it had just been disturbed.\n",
      "Behind the altar, Langdon and Sienna crouched in silence. They had barely had time to\n",
      "collect the dirty towels and straighten the font cover before diving out of sight behind the\n",
      "main altar, with the death mask carefully in tow. The plan was to hide here until the\n",
      "room filled up with tourists, and then discreetly exit among the crowd.\n",
      "The baptistry’s north door had definitely just been opened—at least for a moment—\n",
      "because Langdon had heard sounds emanating from the piazza, but then just as abruptly,\n",
      "the door had been closed, and all had gone quiet again.\n",
      "Now, back in the silence, Langdon heard a single set of footsteps moving across the\n",
      "stone floor.\n",
      "A docent? Checking the room before opening it to tourists later today?\n",
      "He had not had time to extinguish the spotlight over the baptismal font and wondered\n",
      "if the docent would notice. \n",
      "Apparently not.\n",
      " The footsteps were moving briskly in their\n",
      "direction, pausing just in front of the altar at the swag that Langdon and Sienna had just\n",
      "vaulted over.\n",
      "There was a long silence.\n",
      "“Robert, it’s me,” a man’s voice said angrily. “I know you’re back there. Get the hell out\n",

      "Langdon motioned for Sienna to remain crouched safely out of sight, holding the Dante\n",
      "death mask, which he had resealed in the Ziploc bag.\n",
      "Then, slowly, Langdon rose to his feet. Standing like a priest behind the altar of the\n",
      "baptistry, Langdon gazed out at his congregation of one. The stranger facing him had\n",
      "sandy-brown hair, designer glasses, and a terrible rash on his face and neck. He\n",
      "scratched nervously at his irritated neck, his swollen eyes flashing daggers of confusion\n",
      "and anger.\n",
      "“You want to tell me what the hell you’re doing, Robert?!” he demanded, stepping over\n",
      "the swag and advancing toward Langdon. His accent was American.\n",
      "“Sure,” Langdon replied politely. “But first, tell me who you are.”\n",
      "The man stopped short, looking incredulous. “What did you say?!”\n",
      "Langdon sensed something vaguely familiar in the man’s eyes … his voice, too, maybe.\n",
      "I’ve met him … somehow, somewhere.\n",
      " Langdon repeated his question calmly. “Please tell\n",
      "me who you are and how I know you.”\n",
      "The man threw up his hands in disbelief. “Jonathan Ferris? World Health Organization?\n",
      "The guy who flew to Harvard University and picked you up!?”\n",
      "Langdon tried to process what he was hearing.\n",
      "“Why haven’t you called in?!” the man demanded, still scratching at his neck and\n",
      "cheeks, which looked red and blistered. “And who the hell is the woman I saw you come\n",

      "in the head last night. He has retrograde amnesia, and he doesn’t know who you are or\n",
      "what happened to him over the last two days. I’m here because I’m helping him.”\n",
      "As Sienna’s words echoed through the empty baptistry, the man cocked his head,\n",
      "puzzled, as if her meaning had not quite registered. After a dazed beat, he staggered\n",
      "back a step, steadying himself on one of the stanchions.\n",
      "“Oh … my God,” he stammered. “That explains everything.”\n",
      "Langdon watched the anger drain from the man’s face.\n",
      "“Robert,” the newcomer whispered, “we thought you had …” He shook his head as if\n",
      "trying to get the pieces to fall into place. “We thought you had switched sides … that\n",

      "bodies, plague victims, and some woman with silver hair and a serpent amulet telling him\n",

      "“Elizabeth!” the man blurted. “That’s Dr. Elizabeth Sinskey! Robert, she’s the person\n",
      "who recruited you to help us!”“Well, if that’s her,” Sienna said, “I hope you know that she’s in trouble. We saw her\n",
      "trapped in the back of a van full of soldiers, and she looked like she’d been drugged or\n",
      "something.”\n",
      "The man nodded slowly, closing his eyes. His eyelids looked puffy and red.\n",
      "“What’s wrong with your face?” Sienna demanded.\n",
      "He opened his eyes. “I’m sorry?”\n",
      "“Your skin? It looks like you contracted something. Are you ill?”\n",
      "The man looked taken aback, and while Sienna’s question was certainly blunt to the\n",
      "point of rudeness, Langdon had wondered the same thing. Considering the number of\n",
      "plague references he’d encountered today, the sight of red, blistering skin was unsettling.\n",
      "“I’m fine,” the man said. “It was the damned hotel soap. I’m deathly allergic to soy,\n",

      "They shared an awkward laugh.\n",
      "“Tell me,” Sienna ventured, “does the name Bertrand Zobrist mean anything to you?”\n",
      "The man froze, looking as if he’d just come face-to-face with the three-headed devil.\n",
      "“We believe we just found a message from him,” Sienna said. “It points to someplace\n",
      "in Venice. Does that make any sense to you?”\n",

      "yes\n",

      "Sienna drew a breath, clearly prepared to tell this man everything about the spiraling\n",
      "poem she and Langdon had just discovered on the mask, but Langdon instinctively placed\n",
      "a quieting hand on hers. The man certainly appeared to be an ally, but after today’s\n",
      "events, Langdon’s gut told him to trust no one. Moreover, the man’s tie rang a bell, and\n",
      "he sensed he might very well be the same man he had seen praying in the small Dante\n",
      "church earlier. \n",
      "Was he following us?\n",

      "me last night to say you had set up a meeting with a museum director named Ignazio\n",
      "Busoni. Then you disappeared. You never called in. When I heard Ignazio Busoni had\n",

      "“Yes! I was trying to figure out what you were doing, but it made no sense! You\n",
      "seemed to leave the church like a man on a mission, and so I followed you. When I saw\n",
      "you sneak into the baptistry, I decided it was time to confront you. I paid off the docent\n",
      "for a couple minutes alone in here.”\n",
      "“Gutsy move,” Langdon noted, “if you thought I had turned on you.”The man shook his head. “Something told me you would never do that. Professor\n",

      "Incredible. I never would have guessed.”\n",

      "“Long story,” the man said. “I’ll explain on the way.”\n",
      "Langdon frowned, not entirely liking this answer. He motioned to Sienna and ushered\n",
      "her off to one side, talking to her in hushed tones. “Do you trust him? What do you\n",
      "think?”\n",

      "“What if he didn’t realize he had the plague?”\n",

      "screwed … along with everyone in the general area.”\n",
      "“You know, your bedside manner could use some work.”\n",
      "“Just being honest.” Sienna handed Langdon the Ziploc bag containing the death mask.\n",
      "“You can carry our little friend.”\n",

      "hard time coming up with any rational explanation for them.\n",
      "Whose side is he on?\n",
      "Admittedly, Sinskey had known Langdon only a few days, but she was usually a good\n",

      "No\n",

      "I know his reputation too well; he’s better than that.\n",
      "Sinskey had first met Robert Langdon four nights before in the gutted hull of a retasked\n",
      "C-130 transport plane, which served as the World Health Organization’s mobile\n",
      "coordination center.\n",
      "It had been just past seven when the plane landed at Hanscom Field, less than fifteen\n",

      "“The honor’s mine. Thanks for all you do.”\n",
      "Langdon was a tall man, with urbane good looks and a deep voice. His clothing at the\n",
      "moment, Sinskey had to assume, was his classroom attire—a tweed jacket, khaki slacks,\n",
      "and loafers—which made sense considering the man had essentially been scooped off his\n",
      "campus with no warning. He also looked younger and far more fit than she’d imagined,\n",
      "which only served to remind Elizabeth of her own age. \n",
      "I could almost be his mother.\n",

      "Yes?\n",

      "“Please, sit. I have something I need you to look at.”\n",
      "Langdon ambled toward the table, and Elizabeth noted that while the \n",

      "seemed intrigued by the prospect of a secret meeting, he did not appear at all unsettled\n",
      "by it. \n",

      "she and her team had confiscated from a Florence safe-deposit box less than twelve\n",
      "hours earlier.\n",
      "Langdon studied the small carved cylinder for a long moment before giving her a quick\n",
      "synopsis of what she already knew. The object was an ancient cylinder seal that could be\n",
      "used for printmaking. It bore a particularly gruesome image of a three-headed Satan\n",
      "along with a single word: \n",
      "saligia\n",
      ".\n",
      "“Saligia,” Langdon said, “is a Latin mnemonic for—”\n",
      "“The Seven Deadly Sins,” Elizabeth said. “Yes, we looked it up.”\n",
      "“Okay …” Langdon sounded puzzled. “Is there some reason you wanted me to look at\n",
      "this?”\n",
      "“Actually, yes.” Sinskey took the cylinder back and began shaking it violently, the\n",
      "agitator ball rattling back and forth.\n",
      "Langdon looked puzzled by her action, but before he could ask what she was doing, the\n",
      "end of the cylinder began to glow, and she pointed it at a smooth patch of insulation on\n",
      "the wall of the gutted plane.\n",
      "Langdon let out a low whistle and moved toward the projected image.\n",

      "Inferno\n",

      "Elizabeth nodded. She and her team had used the Internet to identify the painting,\n",
      "which Sinskey had been surprised to learn was a Botticelli, a painter best known for his\n",
      "bright, idealized masterpieces \n",
      "Birth of Venus\n",
      " and \n",
      "Springtime\n",
      ". Sinskey loved both of those\n",
      "works despite the fact that they portrayed fertility and the creation of life, which only\n",
      "served to remind her of her own tragic inability to conceive—the lone significant regret in\n",
      "her otherwise very productive life.\n",
      "“I was hoping,” Sinskey said, “that you could tell me about the symbolism hidden in\n",
      "this painting.”\n",
      "Langdon looked irritated for the first time all night. “Is that why you called me in? I\n",
      "thought you said it was an emergency.”\n",
      "“Humor me.”\n",
      "Langdon heaved a patient sigh. “Dr. Sinskey, generally speaking, if you want to know\n",
      "about a specific painting, you should contact the museum that contains the original. In\n",
      "this case, that would be the Vatican’s Biblioteca \n",
      "Apostolica. The Vatican has a number of\n",
      "superb iconographers who—”\n",
      "“The Vatican hates me.”\n",
      "Langdon gave her a startled look. “You, too? I thought I was the only one.”\n",
      "She smiled sadly. “The WHO feels strongly that the widespread availability of\n",
      "contraception is one of the keys to global health—both to combat sexually transmitted\n",
      "diseases like AIDS and also for general population control.”\n",
      "“And the Vatican feels differently.”\n",
      "“Quite. They have spent enormous amounts of energy and money indoctrinating third-\n",
      "world countries into a belief in the evils of contraception.”\n",
      "“Ah, yes,” Langdon said with a knowing smile. “Who better than a bunch of celibate\n",
      "male octogenarians to tell the world how to have sex?”\n",
      "Sinskey was liking the professor more and more every second.\n",
      "She shook the cylinder to recharge it and then projected the image on the wall again.\n",
      "“Professor, take a closer look.”\n",
      "Langdon walked toward the image, studying it, still moving closer. Suddenly he\n",
      "stopped short. “That’s strange. It’s been altered.”\n",
      "That didn’t take him long.\n",
      " “Yes, it has, and I want you to tell me what the alterations\n",
      "mean.”\n",
      "Langdon fell silent, scanning the entire image, pausing to take in the ten letters that\n",
      "spelled \n",
      "catrovacer\n",
      " … and then the plague mask … and also the strange quote around the\n",
      "border about “the eyes of death.”\n",
      "“Who did this?” Langdon demanded. “Where did it come from?”\n",
      "“Actually, the less you know right now the better. What I’m hoping is that you’ll be able\n",
      "to analyze these alterations and tell us what they mean.” She motioned to a desk in the\n",
      "corner.\n",
      "“Here? Right now?”\n",
      "She nodded. “I know it’s an imposition, but I can’t stress enough how important this is\n",
      "to us.” She paused. “It could well be a matter of life and death.”Langdon studied her with concern. “Deciphering this may take a while, but I suppose if\n",
      "it’s that important to you—”\n",
      "“Thank you,” Sinskey interjected before he could change his mind. “Is there anyone you\n",
      "need to call?”\n",
      "Langdon shook his head and told her he had been planning on a quiet weekend alone.\n",
      "Perfect.\n",
      " Sinskey got him settled at his desk with the projector, paper, pencil, and a\n",

      "WHO would be interested in a modified painting by Botticelli, but he dutifully set to work.\n",
      "Dr. Sinskey imagined he might end up studying the image for hours with no\n",
      "breakthrough, and so she settled in to get some work of her own done. From time to time\n",
      "she could hear him shaking the projector and scribbling on his notepad. Barely ten\n",
      "minutes had passed when Langdon set down his pencil and announced, \n",
      "“Cerca trova.”\n",

      "they were replaced in their proper sequence, they spelled the Italian phrase \n",
      "cerca trova.\n",
      "Seek and find?\n",
      " Sinskey wondered. \n",
      "That’s this lunatic’s message to me?\n",
      " The phrase\n",
      "sounded like a direct challenge. The disturbing memory of the madman’s final words to\n",

      "observe the teaching that is hidden here …\n",
      "beneath the veil of verses so obscure.\n",
      "“As I mentioned earlier,” Langdon began, “the opening stanza of Zobrist’s poem is\n",
      "taken verbatim from Dante’s \n",
      "Inferno\n",
      "—an admonition to the reader that the words carry a\n",
      "deeper meaning.”\n",
      "Dante’s allegorical work was so replete with veiled commentary on religion, politics,\n",
      "and philosophy that Langdon often suggested to his students that the Italian poet be\n",
      "studied much as one might study the Bible—reading between the lines in an effort to\n",
      "understand the deeper meaning.\n",
      "“Scholars of medieval allegory,” Langdon continued, “generally divide their analyses\n",
      "into two categories—‘text’ and ‘image’ … text being the literal content of the work, and\n",
      "image being the symbolic message.”\n",
      "“Okay,” Ferris said eagerly. “So the fact that the poem begins with this line—”\n",
      "“Suggests,” Sienna interjected, “that our superficial reading may reveal only part of the\n",
      "story. The true meaning may be hidden.”\n",
      "“Something like that, yes.” Langdon returned his gaze to the text and continued\n",
      "reading aloud.\n",
      "Seek the treacherous doge of Venice\n",
      "who severed the heads from horses …\n",
      "and plucked up the bones of the blind.\n",
      "“Well,” Langdon said, “I’m not sure about headless horses and the bones of the blind,\n",
      "but it sounds like we’re supposed to locate a specific doge.”\n",
      "“I assume … a doge’s grave?” Sienna asked. “Or a statue or portrait?” Langdon replied.\n",
      "“There haven’t been doges for centuries.”\n",
      "The doges of Venice were similar to the dukes of the other Italian city-states, and more\n",

      "in A.D. 697. Their lineage had ended in the late eighteenth century with Napoleon’s\n",
      "conquest, but their glory and power still remain subjects of intense fascination for\n",
      "historians.\n",
      "“As you may know,” Langdon said, “Venice’s two most popular tourist attractions—the\n",
      "Doge’s Palace and St. Mark’s Basilica—were built by the doges, for the doges. Many ofthem are buried right there.”\n",
      "“And do you know,” Sienna asked, eyeing the poem, “if there was a doge who was\n",
      "considered to be particularly dangerous?”\n",
      "Langdon glanced down at the line in question. \n",
      "Seek the treacherous doge of Venice.\n",
      "“None that I know of, but the poem doesn’t use the word ‘dangerous’; it uses the word\n",
      "‘treacherous.’ There’s a difference, at least in the world of Dante. Treachery is one of the\n",
      "Seven Deadly Sins—the worst of them, actually—punished in the ninth and final ring of\n",
      "hell.”\n",
      "Treachery, as defined by Dante, was the act of betraying a loved one. History’s most\n",
      "notorious example of the sin had been Judas’s betrayal of his beloved Jesus, an act Dante\n",
      "considered so vile that he had Judas banished to the inferno’s innermost core—a region\n",
      "named Judecca, after its most dishonorable resident.\n",
      "“Okay,” Ferris said, “so we’re looking for a doge who committed an act of treachery.”\n",
      "Sienna nodded her agreement. “That will help us limit the list of possibilities.” She\n",
      "paused, eyeing the text. “But this next line … a doge who ‘severed the heads from\n",

      "Langdon was already considering all of Venice’s best-known museums—the Gallerie\n",
      "dell’Accademia, the Ca’ Rezzonico, the Palazzo Grassi, the Peggy Guggenheim Collection,\n",
      "the Museo Correr—but none of them seemed to fit the description.\n",

      "Kneel within the gilded \n",
      "mouseion\n",
      " of holy wisdom …\n",
      "Langdon smiled wryly. “Venice does have one museum that perfectly qualifies as a\n",
      "‘gilded mouseion of holy wisdom.’ ”\n",
      "Both Ferris and Sienna looked at him expectantly.\n",
      "“St. Mark’s Basilica,” he declared. “The largest church in Venice.”\n",
      "Ferris looked uncertain. “The church is a museum?”\n",
      "Langdon nodded. “Much like the Vatican Museum. And what’s more, \n",
      "the interior of St.\n",
      "Mark’s is famous for being adorned, in its entirety, in solid gold tiles.”\n",
      "“A \n",
      "gilded mouseion\n",
      ",” Sienna said, sounding genuinely excited.\n",
      "Langdon nodded, having no doubt that St. Mark’s was the gilded temple referenced in\n",
      "the poem. For centuries, the Venetians had called St. Mark’s La Chiesa d’Oro—the Church\n",
      "of Gold—and Langdon considered its interior the most dazzling of any church in the world.\n",
      "“The poem says to ‘kneel’ there,” Ferris added. “And a church is a logical place to\n",
      "kneel.”\n",
      "Sienna was typing furiously again. “I’ll add St. Mark’s to the search. That must be\n",
      "where we need to look for the doge.”\n",
      "Langdon knew they would find no shortage of doges in St. Mark’s—which was, quite\n",
      "literally, the basilica of the doges. He felt encouraged as he returned his eyes to the\n",
      "poem.\n",
      "Kneel within the gilded \n",
      "mouseion\n",
      " of holy wisdom,\n",
      "and place thine ear to the ground,\n",
      "listening for the sounds of trickling water.\n",
      "Trickling water?\n",
      " Langdon wondered. \n",
      "Is there water under St. Mark’s?\n",
      " The question, he\n",
      "realized, was foolish. There was water under the entire city. Every building in Venice was\n",
      "slowly sinking and leaking. Langdon pictured the basilica and tried to imagine where\n",
      "inside one might kneel to listen for trickling water. \n",
      "And once we hear it … what do we do?\n",
      "Langdon returned to the poem and finished reading aloud.\n",
      "Follow deep into the sunken palace …\n",
      "for here, in the darkness, the chthonic monster waits,\n",
      "submerged in the bloodred waters …\n",
      "of the lagoon that reflects no stars.\n",
      "“Okay,” Langdon said, disturbed by the image, “apparently, we follow the sounds of\n",
      "trickling water … to some kind of sunken palace.”\n",
      "Ferris scratched at his face, looking unnerved. “What’s a chthonic monster?”\n",
      "“Subterranean,” Sienna offered, her fingers still working the phone. “ ‘Chthonic’ means‘beneath the earth.’ ”\n",
      "“Partly, yes,” Langdon said. “Although the word has a further historic implication—one\n",
      "commonly associated with myths and monsters. \n",
      "Chthonics\n",
      " are an entire category of\n",
      "mythical gods and monsters—Erinyes, \n",
      "Hecate, and Medusa, for example. They’re called\n",
      "chthonics because they reside in the underworld and are associated with hell.” Langdon\n",
      "paused. “Historically, they emerge from the earth and come aboveground to wreak havoc\n",
      "in the human world.”\n",
      "There was a long silence, and Langdon sensed they were all thinking the same thing.\n",
      "This chthonic monster … could only be Zobrist’s plague.\n",
      "for here, in the darkness, the chthonic monster waits,\n",
      "submerged in the bloodred waters …\n",
      "of the lagoon that reflects no stars.\n",
      "“Anyway,” Langdon said, trying to stay on track, “we’re obviously looking for an\n",
      "underground location, which at least explains the last line of the poem referencing ‘the\n",
      "lagoon that reflects no stars.’ ”\n",
      "“Good point,” Sienna said, glancing up now from Ferris’s phone. “If a lagoon is\n",
      "subterranean, it couldn’t reflect the sky. But does Venice have subterranean lagoons?”\n",
      "“None that I know of,” Langdon replied. “But in a city built on water, there are probably\n",
      "endless possibilities.”\n",
      "“What if the lagoon is indoors?” Sienna asked suddenly, eyeing them both. “The poem\n",
      "refers to ‘the darkness’ of ‘the sunken palace.’ You mentioned earlier that the Doge’s\n",
      "Palace is connected to the basilica, right? That means those structures have a lot of what\n",
      "the poem mentions—a mouseion of holy wisdom, a palace, relevance to doges—and it’s\n",
      "all located right there on Venice’s main lagoon, at sea level.”\n",
      "Langdon considered this. “You think the poem’s ‘sunken palace’ is the Doge’s Palace?”\n",
      "“Why not? The poem tells us first to kneel at St. Mark’s Basilica, then to follow the\n",
      "sounds of trickling water. Maybe the sounds of water lead next door to the Doge’s Palace.\n",
      "It could have a submerged foundation or something.”\n",
      "Langdon had visited the Doge’s Palace many times and knew that it was absolutely\n",
      "massive. A sprawling complex of buildings, the palace housed a grand-scale museum, a\n",
      "veritable labyrinth of institutional chambers, apartments, and courtyards, and a prison\n",
      "network so vast that it was housed in multiple buildings.\n",
      "“You may be right,” Langdon said, “but a blind search of that palace would take days. I\n",
      "suggest we do exactly as the poem tells us. First, we go to St. Mark’s Basilica and find the\n",
      "tomb or statue of this treacherous doge, and then we kneel down.”\n",
      "“And then?” Sienna asked.\n",
      "“And then,” Langdon said with a sigh, “we pray like hell that we hear trickling water …\n",
      "and it leads us somewhere.”\n",
      "In the silence that followed, Langdon pictured the anxious face of Elizabeth Sinskey as\n",
      "he had seen it in his hallucinations, calling to him across the water. \n",
      "Time is short. Seek\n",
      "and find!\n",
      " He wondered where Sinskey was now … and if she was all right. The soldiers in\n",
      "black had no doubt realized by now that Langdon and Sienna had escaped. \n",
      "How longuntil they come after us?\n",
      "As Langdon returned his eyes to the poem, he fought off a wave of exhaustion. He\n",
      "eyed the final line of verse, and another thought occurred to him. He wondered if it was\n",
      "even worth mentioning. \n",
      "The lagoon that reflects no stars.\n",
      " It was probably irrelevant to\n",
      "their search, but he decided to share it nonetheless. “There’s another point I should\n",
      "mention.”\n",
      "Sienna glanced up from the cell phone.\n",
      "“The three sections of Dante’s \n",
      "Divine Comedy\n",

      "Inferno\n",

      "“What word is that?” Ferris asked.\n",
      "Langdon pointed to the bottom of the text he had transcribed. “The same word that\n",
      "ends \n",

      "“No problem!” Their driver gave a wave. “Two minutes!”\n",
      "The limo had now come even with St. Mark’s Square, and the Doge’s Palace rose\n",
      "majestically to their right, dominating the shoreline.\n",
      "A perfect example of Venetian Gothic architecture, the palace was an exercise in\n",
      "understated elegance. With none of the turrets or spires normally associated with the\n",
      "palaces of France or England, it was conceived as a massive rectangular prism, which\n",
      "provided for the largest possible amount of interior square footage in which to house the\n",

      "“What are they looking at?” Ferris demanded, sounding nervous.\n",
      "“Il Ponte dei Sospiri,” Sienna replied. “A famous Venetian bridge.”\n",

      "immediately developed a boyhood crush … a crush that, admittedly, he had never quite\n",
      "shaken.\n",
      "Years later, Langdon had been horrified to learn that the Bridge of Sighs drew its name\n",
      "not from sighs of passion … but instead from sighs of misery. As it turned out, the\n",
      "enclosed walkway served as the connector between the Doge’s Palace and the doge’s\n",

      "of the grated windows along the narrow canal.\n",
      "Langdon had visited the prison once, and was surprised to learn that the most terrifying\n",
      "cells were not those at water level, which often flooded, but those next door on the top\n",
      "floor of the palace proper—called \n",
      "piombi\n",

      "extended a hand down into the boat, offering to help his passengers out.\n",
      "“Thanks,” Langdon said as the muscular Italian pulled him ashore.\n",

      "more square in appearance than the elongated rectangles of St. Peter’s or Notre-Dame.\n",
      "With a shorter distance from narthex to altar, St. Mark’s exuded a robust, sturdy quality,\n",

      "in Constantinople, St. Mark’s was so eastern in style that guidebooks often suggested it\n",
      "as a viable alternative to visiting Turkish mosques, many of which were Byzantine\n",
      "cathedrals that had been turned into Muslim houses of worship.\n",
      "While Langdon would never consider St. Mark’s a stand-in for the spectacular mosques\n",

      "with a visit to the secret suite of rooms just off the right transept in this church, in which\n",
      "was hidden the so-called Treasure of St. Mark—a glittering collection of 283 precious\n",
      "icons, jewels, and chalices acquired during the looting of Constantinople.\n",
      "Langdon was pleased to find the basilica relatively quiet this afternoon. There were still\n",
      "throngs of people, but at least there was room to maneuver. Weaving in and out of\n",
      "various groups, Langdon guided Ferris and Sienna toward the west window, where\n",
      "visitors could step outside and see the horses on the balcony. Despite Langdon’s\n",

      "real\n",
      " Horses of St. Mark’s are kept inside for safety and preservation.”\n",
      "Langdon guided Sienna and Ferris along a corridor toward a well-lit alcove where an\n",

      "rippling skin was the sumptuous, golden-green verdigris that entirely covered their\n",
      "surface. For Langdon, seeing these four stallions perfectly maintained despite their\n",
      "tumultuous past was always a reminder of the importance of preserving great art.\n",
      "“Their collars,” Sienna said, motioning to the decorative breast collars around their\n",
      "necks. “You said those were added? To cover the seam?”\n",
      "Langdon had told Sienna and Ferris about the strange “severed head” detail he had\n",
      "read about on the ARCA Web site.\n",
      "“Apparently, yes,” Langdon said, moving toward an informational placard posted\n",
      "nearby.\n",
      "“Roberto!” a friendly voice bellowed behind them. “You insult me!” Langdon turned to\n",
      "see Ettore Vio, a jovial-looking, white-haired man in a blue suit, with eyeglasses on a\n",
      "chain around his neck, pushing his way through the crowd. “You dare to come to my\n",

      "Langdon smiled and shook the man’s hand. “I like to surprise you, Ettore. You look\n",
      "good. These are my friends Dr. Brooks and Dr. Ferris.”\n",
      "Ettore greeted them and then stood back, appraising Langdon. “Traveling with doctors?\n",
      "Are you sick? And your clothing? Are you turning Italian?”\n",
      "“Neither,” Langdon said, chuckling. “I’ve come for some information on the horses.”\n",
      "Ettore looked intrigued. “There is something the famous professor does not already\n",

      "Langdon laughed. “I need to learn about the severing of these horses’ heads for\n",
      "transport during the Crusades.”\n",
      "Ettore Vio looked as if Langdon had just inquired about the Queen’s hemorrhoids.\n",
      "“Heavens, Robert,” he whispered, “we don’t speak of that. If you want to see severed\n",

      "“Ettore, I need to know \n",

      "historically there is little to suggest that any doge committed—”\n",
      "“Ettore, please, humor me,” Langdon said. “According to the tale, which doge was it?”\n",

      "Constantinople instead.”\n",
      "Sounds like treachery\n",
      ", Langdon mused. “And what was his name?”\n",
      "Ettore frowned. “Robert, I thought you were a student of world history.”\n",
      "“Yes, but the world is large, and history is long. I could use some help.”\n",
      "“Very well then, a final clue.”\n",
      "Langdon was going to protest, but he sensed that he’d be wasting his breath.“Your doge lived for nearly a century,” Ettore said. “A miracle in his day. Superstition\n",
      "attributed his longevity to his brave act of rescuing the bones of Saint Lucia from\n",
      "Constantinople and bringing them back to Venice. Saint Lucia lost her eyes to—”\n",
      "“He plucked up the bones of the blind!” Sienna blurted, glancing at Langdon, who had\n",
      "just had the same thought.\n",
      "Ettore gave Sienna an odd look. “In a manner of speaking, I suppose.”\n",
      "Ferris looked suddenly wan, as if he had not yet caught his breath from the long walk\n",
      "across the plaza and the climb up the stairs.\n",
      "“I should add,” Ettore said, “that the doge loved Saint Lucia so much because the doge\n",
      "himself was blind. At the age of ninety, he stood out in this very square, unable to see a\n",
      "thing, and preached the Crusade.”\n",
      "“I know who it is,” Langdon said.\n",
      "“Well, I should hope so!” Ettore replied with a smile.\n",
      "Because his eidetic memory was better suited to images rather than uncontextualized\n",
      "ideas, Langdon’s revelation had arrived in the form of a piece of artwork—a famous\n",
      "illustration by Gustave Doré depicting a wizened, blind doge, arms raised high overhead\n",
      "as he incited a gathered crowd to join the Crusade. The name of Doré’s illustration was\n",

      "Dandolo Preaching the Crusade.\n",
      "“Enrico Dandolo,” Langdon declared. “The doge who lived forever.”\n",
      "“Finalmente!”\n",
      " Ettore said. “I fear your mind has aged, my friend.”\n",
      "“Along with the rest of me. Is he buried here?”\n",
      "“Dandolo?” Ettore shook his head. “No, not here.”\n",
      "“Where?” Sienna demanded. “At the Doge’s Palace?”\n",
      "Ettore took off his glasses, thinking a moment. “Give me a moment. There are so many\n",
      "doges, I can’t recall—”\n",
      "Before Ettore could finish, a frightened-looking docent came running over and ushered\n",
      "him aside, whispering in his ear. Ettore stiffened, looking alarmed, and immediately\n",
      "hurried over to a railing, where he peered down into the sanctuary below. After a\n",
      "moment he turned back toward Langdon.\n",
      "“I’ll be right back,” Ettore shouted, and then hurried off without another word.\n",
      "Puzzled, Langdon went over to the railing and peered over. \n",
      "What’s going on down\n",
      "there?\n",
      "At first he saw nothing at all, just tourists milling around. After a moment, though, he\n",
      "realized that many of the visitors were staring in the same direction, toward the main\n",
      "entrance, through which an imposing group of black-clad soldiers had just entered the\n",
      "church and was fanning out across the narthex, blocking all the exits.\n",
      "The soldiers in black.\n",
      " Langdon felt his hands tighten on the railing.\n",

      " “Robert,” she called\n",
      "more urgently. “Something’s wrong! Help me!” Langdon turned from the railing, puzzled\n",
      "by her cries for help.\n",
      "Where did she go?\n",
      "An instant later, his eyes found both Sienna and Ferris. On the floor in front of theHorses of St. Mark’s, Sienna was kneeling over Dr. Ferris … who had collapsed in\n",

      "CHAPTER 75\n",
      "I THINK HE’S\n",
      " having a heart attack!” Sienna shouted.\n",
      "Langdon hurried over to where Dr. Ferris lay sprawled on the floor. The man was\n",
      "gasping, unable to catch his breath.\n",
      "What happened to him?!\n",
      " For Langdon, everything had come to a head in a single\n",
      "moment. With the soldiers’ arrival downstairs and Ferris thrashing on the floor, Langdon\n",
      "felt momentarily paralyzed, unsure which way to turn.\n",
      "Sienna crouched down over Ferris and loosened his necktie, tearing open the top few\n",
      "buttons of his shirt to help him breathe. But as the man’s shirt parted, Sienna recoiled\n",
      "and let out a sharp cry of alarm, covering her mouth as she staggered backward, staring\n",
      "down at the bare flesh of his chest.\n",
      "Langdon saw it, too.\n",
      "The skin of Ferris’s chest was deeply discolored. An ominous-looking bluish-black\n",
      "blemish the circumference of a grapefruit spread out across his sternum. Ferris looked like\n",
      "he’d been hit in the chest with a cannonball.\n",
      "“That’s internal bleeding,” Sienna said, glancing up at Langdon with a look of shock.\n",
      "“No wonder he’s been having trouble breathing all day.”\n",
      "Ferris twisted his head, clearly trying to speak, but he could only make faint wheezing\n",
      "sounds. Tourists had started gathering around, and Langdon sensed that the situation\n",
      "was about to get chaotic.\n",
      "“The soldiers are downstairs,” Langdon warned Sienna. “I don’t know how they found\n",
      "us.”\n",
      "The look of surprise and fear on Sienna’s face turned quickly to anger, and she glared\n",
      "back down at Ferris. “You’ve been lying to us, haven’t you?”\n",
      "Ferris attempted to speak again, but he could barely make a sound. Sienna roughly\n",
      "searched Ferris’s pockets and pulled out his wallet and phone, which she slipped into her\n",
      "own pocket, standing over him now with an accusatory glower.\n",
      "At that moment an elderly Italian woman pushed through the crowd, shouting angrily\n",
      "at Sienna. \n",
      "“L’hai colpito al petto!”\n",
      " She made a forceful motion with her fist against her\n",
      "own chest.\n",
      "“No!”\n",
      " Sienna snapped. “CPR will kill him! Look at his chest!” She turned to Langdon.\n",
      "“Robert, we need to get out of here. Now.”\n",
      "Langdon looked down at Ferris, who desperately locked eyes with him, pleading, as if\n",
      "he wanted to communicate something.\n",
      "“We can’t just leave him!” Langdon said frantically.\n",
      "“Trust me,” Sienna said. “That’s not a heart attack. And we’re leaving. \n",
      "Now\n",
      ".”\n",
      "As the crowd closed in, tourists began shouting for help. Sienna gripped Langdon’s arm\n",
      "with startling force and dragged him away from the chaos, out into the fresh air of the\n",
      "balcony.\n",
      "For a moment Langdon was blinded. The sun was directly in front of his eyes, sinkinglow over the western end of St. Mark’s Square, bathing the entire balcony in a golden\n",
      "light. Sienna led Langdon to their left along the second-story terrace, snaking through the\n",
      "tourists who had stepped outside to admire the piazza and the replicas of the Horses of\n",
      "St. Mark’s.\n",
      "As they rushed along the front of the basilica, the lagoon was straight ahead. Out on\n",
      "the water, a strange silhouette caught Langdon’s eye—an ultramodern yacht that looked\n",
      "like some kind of futuristic warship.\n",
      "Before he could give it a second thought, he and Sienna had cut left again, following\n",
      "the balcony around the southwest corner of the basilica toward the “Paper Door”—the\n",
      "annex connecting the basilica to the Doge’s Palace—so named because the doges posted\n",
      "decrees there for the public to read.\n",
      "Not a heart attack?\n",
      " The image of Ferris’s black-and-blue chest was imprinted in\n",
      "Langdon’s mind, and he suddenly felt fearful at the prospect of hearing Sienna’s diagnosis\n",
      "of the man’s actual illness. Moreover, it seemed something had shifted, and Sienna no\n",
      "longer trusted Ferris. \n",
      "Was that why she was trying to catch my eye earlier?\n",
      "Sienna suddenly skidded to a stop and leaned out over the elegant balustrade, peering\n",
      "down into a cloistered corner of St. Mark’s Square far below.\n",
      "“Damn it,” she said. “We’re higher up than I thought.”\n",
      "Langdon stared at her. \n",
      "You were thinking of jumping?!\n",
      "Sienna looked frightened. “We can’t let them catch us, Robert.”\n",
      "Langdon turned back toward the basilica, eyeing the heavy door of wrought iron and\n",
      "glass directly behind them. Tourists were entering and \n",
      "exiting, and if Langdon’s estimate\n",
      "was correct, passing through the door would deposit them back inside the museum near\n",
      "the back of the church.\n",
      "“They’ll have all the exits covered,” Sienna said.\n",
      "Langdon considered their escape options and arrived at only one. “I think I saw\n",
      "something inside that could solve that problem.”\n",
      "Barely able to fathom what he was even now considering, Langdon guided Sienna back\n",
      "inside the basilica. They skirted the perimeter of the museum, trying to stay out of sight\n",
      "among the crowd, many of whom were now looking diagonally across the vast open\n",
      "space of the central nave toward the commotion going on around Ferris. Langdon spied\n",
      "the angry old Italian woman directing a pair of black-clad soldiers out onto the balcony,\n",
      "revealing Langdon and Sienna’s escape route.\n",
      "We’ll have to hurry\n",
      ", Langdon thought, scanning the walls and finally spotting what he\n",
      "was looking for near a large display of tapestries.\n",
      "The device on the wall was bright yellow with a red warning sticker: \n",
      "ALLARME\n",
      "ANTINCENDIO\n",
      ".\n",
      "“A fire alarm?” Sienna said. “That’s your plan?”\n",
      "“We can slip out with the crowd.” Langdon reached up and grabbed the alarm lever.\n",
      "Here goes nothing\n",
      ". Acting quickly before he could think better of it, he pulled down hard,\n",
      "seeing the mechanism cleanly shatter the small glass cylinder inside.\n",
      "The sirens and pandemonium that Langdon expected never came.\n",
      "Only silence.He pulled again.\n",
      "Nothing.\n",
      "Sienna stared at him like he was crazy. “Robert, we’re in a stone cathedral packed with\n",

      "active\n",
      " when a single prankster could—”\n",
      "“Of course! Fire laws in the U.S.—”\n",
      "“You’re in Europe. We have fewer lawyers.” She pointed over Langdon’s shoulder. “And\n",
      "we’re also out of time.”\n",
      "Langdon turned toward the glass door through which they’d just entered and saw two\n",
      "soldiers hurrying in from the balcony, their hard eyes scanning the area. Langdon\n",
      "recognized one as the same muscular agent who had fired at them on the Trike as they\n",
      "were fleeing Sienna’s apartment.\n",
      "With precious few options, Langdon and Sienna slipped out of sight in an enclosed\n",
      "spiral stairwell, descending back to the ground floor. When they reached the landing, they\n",

      "tunnel, disappearing into the void.\n",
      "“It’s open,” Sienna whispered from below.\n",
      "Langdon was not surprised. The crypt of St. Mark’s was different from many other such\n",
      "places in that it was also a working chapel, where regular services were held in the\n",
      "presence of the bones of St. Mark.\n",
      "“I think I see natural light!” Sienna whispered.\n",
      "How is that possible?\n",
      " Langdon tried to recall his previous visits to this sacred\n",
      "underground space and guessed that Sienna was probably seeing the \n",
      "lux eterna\n",
      "—an\n",
      "electric light that remained lit on St. Mark’s tomb in the center of the crypt. With\n",
      "footsteps approaching from above him, though, Langdon didn’t have time to think. He\n",
      "quickly stepped over the swag, making sure he didn’t move it, and then he placed his\n",
      "palm on the rough-hewn stone wall, feeling his way down around the curve and out of\n",
      "sight.\n",
      "Sienna was waiting for him at the bottom of the stairs. Behind her, the crypt was barely\n",
      "visible in the darkness. It was a squat subterranean chamber with an alarmingly low\n",
      "stone ceiling supported by ancient pillars and brick-vaulted archways. \n",
      "The weight of the\n",
      "entire basilica rests on these pillars\n",
      ", Langdon thought, already feeling claustrophobic.\n",
      "“Told you,” Sienna whispered, her pretty face faintly illuminated by the hint of muted\n",
      "natural light. She pointed to several small, arched transoms, high on the wall.\n",
      "Light wells\n",
      ", Langdon realized, having forgotten they were here. The wells—designed to\n",
      "bring light and fresh air into this cramped crypt—opened into deep shafts that dropped\n",
      "down from St. Mark’s Square above. The window glass was reinforced with a tightironwork pattern of fifteen interlocking circles, and although Langdon suspected that they\n",
      "could be opened from inside, they were shoulder height and would be a tight fit. Even if\n",
      "they somehow managed to get through the window into the shaft, climbing out of the\n",
      "shafts would be impossible, since they were ten feet deep and covered by heavy security\n",
      "grates at the top.\n",
      "In the dim light that filtered through the wells, St. Mark’s crypt resembled a moonlit\n",
      "forest—a dense grove of trunklike pillars that cast long and heavy-looking shadows across\n",
      "the ground. Langdon turned his gaze to the center of the crypt, where a lone light burned\n",
      "at St. Mark’s tomb. The basilica’s namesake rested in a stone sarcophagus behind an\n",
      "altar, before which there were lines of pews for those lucky few invited to worship here at\n",
      "the heart of Venetian Christendom.\n",
      "A tiny light suddenly flickered to life beside him and Langdon turned to see Sienna\n",
      "holding the illuminated screen of Ferris’s phone.\n",
      "Langdon did a double take. “I thought Ferris said his battery was dead!”\n",
      "“He lied,” Sienna said, still typing. “About a lot of things.” She frowned at the phone\n",
      "and shook her head. “No signal. I thought maybe I could find the location of Enrico\n",
      "Dandolo’s tomb.” She hurried over to the light well and held the phone high overhead\n",
      "near the glass, trying to get a signal.\n",
      "Enrico Dandolo\n",
      ", Langdon thought, having barely had a chance to consider the doge\n",
      "before having to flee the area. Despite their current predicament, their visit to St. Mark’s\n",
      "had indeed served its purpose—revealing the identity of the treacherous doge who\n",
      "severed the heads from horses … and plucked up the bones of the blind.\n",
      "Unfortunately, Langdon had no idea where Enrico Dandolo’s tomb was located, and\n",
      "apparently neither did Ettore Vio. \n",
      "He knows every inch of this basilica … probably of the\n",
      "Doge’s Palace, too.\n",
      " The fact that Ettore hadn’t immediately located Dandolo’s tomb\n",
      "suggested to Langdon that the tomb was probably nowhere near St. Mark’s or the Doge’s\n",
      "Palace.\n",
      "So where is it?\n",
      "Langdon glanced over at Sienna, who was now standing on a pew that she had moved\n",
      "under one of the light wells. She unlatched the window, swung it open, and held Ferris’s\n",
      "phone out into the open air of the shaft itself.\n",
      "The outdoor sounds of St. Mark’s Square filtered down from above, and Langdon\n",
      "suddenly wondered if maybe there \n",
      "was\n",
      " some way out of here after all. There was a line\n",
      "of folding chairs behind the pews, and Langdon sensed that he might be able to hoist one\n",
      "up into the light well. \n",
      "Maybe the upper grates unlatch from inside as well?\n",
      "Langdon hurried through the darkness toward Sienna. He had taken only a few steps\n",
      "when a powerful blow to his forehead knocked him backward. Crumpling to his knees, he\n",
      "thought for an instant that he had been attacked. He had not, he quickly realized, cursing\n",
      "himself for not \n",
      "anticipating that his six-foot frame far exceeded the height of vaults built\n",
      "for the average human height of more than a thousand years ago.\n",
      "As he knelt there on the hard stone and let the stars clear, he found himself gazing at\n",
      "an inscription on the floor.\n",
      "Sanctus Marcus.He stared at it a long moment. It was not St. Mark’s name in the inscription that struck\n",
      "him but rather the language in which it was written.\n",
      "Latin.\n",
      "After his daylong immersion in modern Italian, Langdon found himself vaguely\n",
      "disoriented to see St. Mark’s name written in Latin, a quick reminder that the dead\n",
      "language was the lingua franca of the Roman Empire at the time of St. Mark’s death.\n",
      "Then a second thought hit Langdon.\n",
      "During the early thirteenth century—the time of Enrico Dandolo and the Fourth Crusade\n",
      "—the language of power was still very much Latin. A Venetian doge who had brought\n",
      "great glory to the Roman Empire by recapturing Constantinople would never have been\n",
      "buried under the name of Enrico Dandolo … instead his Latin name would have been\n",
      "used.\n",
      "Henricus Dandolo.\n",
      "And with that, a long-forgotten image struck him like a jolt of electricity. Although the\n",
      "revelation had come while he was kneeling in a chapel, he knew it was not divinely\n",
      "inspired. More likely, it was nothing more than a visual cue that sparked his mind to make\n",
      "a sudden connection. The image that leaped suddenly from the depths of Langdon’s\n",
      "memory was that of Dandolo’s Latin name … engraved in a worn marble slab, embedded\n",
      "in an ornate tile floor.\n",
      "Henricus Dandolo.\n",
      "Langdon could barely breathe as he pictured the doge’s simple tomb marker. \n",
      "I’ve been\n",
      "there.\n",
      " Precisely as the poem had promised, Enrico Dandolo was indeed buried in a gilded\n",
      "museum—a mouseion of holy wisdom—but it was not St. Mark’s Basilica.\n",
      "As the truth settled in, Langdon clambered slowly to his feet.\n",
      "“I can’t get a signal,” Sienna said, climbing down from the light well and coming toward\n",
      "him.\n",
      "“You don’t need one,” Langdon managed. “The gilded mouseion of holy wisdom …” He\n",
      "took a deep breath. “I … made a mistake.”\n",

      "And just what are you doing?\n",

      "an awkward twist of limbs, he exchanged positions with the blond woman and climbed up\n",
      "on top of the rickety chair. He was taller, and when he reached up, he was able to\n",
      "unlatch the security bar beneath the grate. Standing on tiptoe, he placed his hands on\n",
      "the \n",
      "grate and heaved upward. The grate rose an inch or so before he had to set it down.\n",
      "“Può darci una mano?”\n",

      "Give you a hand?\n",

      "What\n",
      "are you doing?\n",
      "The blond woman pulled out a man’s wallet and extracted a hundred-euro bill, waving\n",

      "No stranger to negotiation, she shook her head and held up two fingers. The blond\n",

      "Disbelieving of her good fortune, the Gypsy shrugged a reluctant yes, trying to look\n",

      "they could synchronize their efforts.\n",
      "As the man heaved again, the Gypsy pulled upward with arms made strong from years\n",
      "of carrying her wares, and the grate swung upward … halfway. Just as she thought theyhad it, there was a loud crash beneath her, and the man disappeared, plummeting back\n",
      "down into the well as the folding chair collapsed beneath him.\n",
      "The iron grate grew instantly heavier in her hands, and she thought she would have to\n",
      "drop it, but the promise of two hundred euros gave her strength, and she managed to\n",

      "clang.\n",
      "Breathless, the Gypsy peered down into the well at the twist of bodies and broken\n",

      "Now they hate me, too.\n",

      "local humanitarian group. When they invited her to join them on a monthlong trip to the\n",
      "Philippines, she jumped at the chance.\n",
      "Sienna imagined they were going to feed poor fishermen or farmers in the countryside,\n",
      "which she had read was a wonderland of geological beauty, with vibrant seabeds and\n",
      "dazzling plains. And so when the group settled in among the throngs in the city of Manila\n",

      "How can one person possibly make a difference?\n",
      "For every one person Sienna fed, there were hundreds more who gazed at her with\n",

      "all of this. As the plane leveled out from its ascent, the small man who called himself the\n",

      "event like a car accident or a sexual assault, the long-term memories can be permanently\n",
      "debilitating. Through the use of benzodiazepines, neuroscientists are now able to treat\n",

      "Sienna played me perfectly\n",
      ", he thought, feeling more sad than angry. He had grown\n",
      "fond of her in the short time they’d been together. Most troubling to Langdon was the\n",
      "distressing question of how a soul as bright and warm as Sienna’s could give itself over\n",
      "entirely to Zobrist’s maniacal solution for overpopulation.\n",
      "I can tell you without a doubt\n",

      "that without some kind of\n",
      "drastic change, the end of our species is coming … The mathematics is indisputable.\n",
      "“And the articles about Sienna?” Langdon asked, recalling the Shakespeare playbill and\n",
      "the pieces about her staggeringly high IQ.\n",
      "“Authentic,” the provost replied. “The best illusions involve as much of the real world as\n",
      "possible. We didn’t have much time to set up, and so Sienna’s computer and real-world\n",
      "personal files were almost all we had to work with. You were never really intended to see\n",
      "any of that unless you began doubting her authenticity.”\n",
      "“Nor use her computer,” Langdon said.“Yes, that was where we lost control. Sienna never expected Sinskey’s SRS team to find\n",
      "the apartment, so when the soldiers moved in, Sienna panicked and had to improvise.\n",
      "She fled on the moped with you, trying to keep the illusion alive. As the entire mission\n",
      "unraveled, I had no choice but to disavow Vayentha, although she broke protocol and\n",
      "pursued you.”\n",
      "“She almost killed me,” Langdon said, recounting for the provost the showdown in the\n",
      "attic of the Palazzo Vecchio, when Vayentha raised her handgun and aimed point-blank at\n",
      "Langdon’s chest. \n",
      "This will only hurt for an instant … but it’s my only choice.\n",
      " Sienna had\n",
      "then darted out and pushed her over the railing, where Vayentha plunged to her death.\n",
      "The provost sighed audibly, considering what Langdon had just said. “I doubt Vayentha\n",
      "was trying to kill you … her gun fires only blanks. Her only hope of redemption at that\n",
      "point was to take control of you. She probably thought if she shot you with a blank, she\n",
      "could make you understand she was not an assassin after all and that you were caught\n",
      "up in an illusion.”\n",
      "The provost paused, thinking a bit, and then continued. “Whether Sienna actually\n",
      "meant to kill Vayentha or was only trying to interfere with the shot, I won’t venture to\n",
      "guess. I’m beginning to realize that I don’t know Sienna Brooks as well as I thought.”\n",
      "Me neither\n",

      "the young woman’s face, he sensed that what she had done to the spike-haired operative\n",
      "was very likely a mistake.\n",
      "Langdon felt unmoored … and utterly alone. He turned toward the window, longing to\n",

      "“Professor?” a quiet voice said behind him, and he turned.\n",
      "Langdon took a startled step backward. Standing before him was Dr. Ferris. The last\n",
      "time Langdon had seen the man, he was writhing on the floor of St. Mark’s Basilica,\n",
      "unable to breathe. Now here he was in the aircraft leaning against the bulkhead, wearing\n",
      "a baseball cap, his face, covered in calamine lotion, a pasty pink. His chest and torso\n",
      "were heavily bandaged, and his breathing was shallow. If Ferris had the plague, nobody\n",
      "seemed too concerned that he was going to spread it.\n",
      "“You’re … \n",
      "alive\n",

      "seeming far more relaxed.\n",
      "“But I thought—” Langdon stopped. “Actually … I’m not sure what to think anymore.”\n",
      "Ferris gave him an empathetic smile. “You’ve heard a lot of lies today. I thought I’d\n",
      "take a moment to apologize. As you may have guessed, I don’t work for the WHO, and I\n",
      "didn’t go to recruit you in Cambridge.”\n",
      "Langdon nodded, too tired to be surprised by anything at this point. “You work for the\n",

      "“Of course not! When you mentioned the plague, I figured it was just a story Sienna\n",

      "the hands of the Creator.Until a man is nothing, God can make nothing out of him.\n",
      " Martin Luther had spoken\n",
      "those words in the sixteenth century, but the concept had been part of the mind-set of\n",
      "builders since the earliest examples of religious architecture.\n",
      "Langdon glanced over at Brüder and Sinskey, who had been staring upward and who\n",
      "now lowered their eyes to earth.\n",
      "“Jesus,” Brüder said.\n",
      "“Yes!” Mirsat said excitedly. “And Allah and Muhammad, too!”\n",
      "Langdon chuckled as their guide directed Brüder’s gaze to the main altar, where a\n",
      "towering mosaic of Jesus was flanked by two massive disks bearing the Arabic names of\n",
      "Muhammad and Allah in ornate calligraphy.\n",
      "“This museum,” Mirsat explained, “in an effort to remind visitors of the diverse uses of\n",
      "this sacred space, displays in tandem both the Christian iconography, from the days when\n",
      "Hagia Sophia was a basilica, and the Islamic iconography, from its days as a mosque.” He\n",
      "gave a proud smile. “Despite the friction between the religions in the real world, we think\n",
      "their symbols work quite nicely together. I know you agree, Professor.”\n",
      "Langdon gave a heartfelt nod, recalling that all of the Christian iconography had been\n",
      "covered in whitewash when the building became a mosque. The restoration of the\n",
      "Christian symbols next to the Muslim symbols had created a mesmerizing effect,\n",
      "particularly because the styles and sensibilities of the two iconographies are polar\n",
      "opposites.\n",
      "While Christian tradition favored literal images of its gods and saints, Islam focused on\n",
      "calligraphy and geometric patterns to represent the \n",
      "beauty of God’s universe. Islamic\n",
      "tradition held that only God could create life, and therefore man has no place creating\n",
      "images of life—not gods, not people, not even animals.\n",
      "Langdon recalled once trying to explain this concept to his students: “A Muslim\n",
      "Michelangelo, for example, would never have painted God’s face on the ceiling of the\n",
      "Sistine Chapel; he would have inscribed the \n",
      "name\n",
      " of God. Depicting God’s face would be\n",
      "considered blasphemy.”\n",
      "Langdon had gone on to explain the reason for this.\n",
      "“Both Christianity and Islam are logocentric,” he told his students, “meaning they are\n",
      "focused on \n",
      "the Word.\n",
      " In Christian tradition, the Word became flesh in the book of John:\n",
      "‘And the Word was made flesh, and He dwelt among us.’ Therefore, it was acceptable to\n",
      "depict the Word as having a human form. In Islamic tradition, however, the Word did \n",
      "not\n",
      "become flesh, and therefore the Word needs to remain in the form of a \n",
      "word\n",
      " … in most\n",
      "cases, calligraphic renderings of the names of the holy figures of Islam.”\n",
      "One of Langdon’s students had summed up the complex history with an amusingly\n",
      "accurate marginal note: “Christians like faces; Muslims like words.”\n",
      "“Here before us,” Mirsat went on, motioning across the spectacular room, “you see a\n",
      "unique blending of Christianity with Islam.”\n",
      "He quickly pointed out the fusion of symbols in the massive apse, most notably the\n",
      "Virgin and Child gazing down upon a \n",
      "mihrab\n",
      "—the semicircular niche in a mosque that\n",
      "indicates the direction of Mecca. Nearby, a staircase rose up to an orator’s pulpit, which\n",
      "resembled the kind from which Christian sermons are delivered, but in fact was a \n",
      "minbar\n",
      ",the holy platform from which an imam leads Friday services. Similarly, the daislike\n",
      "structure nearby resembled a Christian choir stall but in reality was a \n",
      "müezzin mahfili\n",
      ", a\n",
      "raised platform where a muezzin kneels and chants in response to the imam’s prayers.\n",
      "“Mosques and cathedrals are startlingly similar,” Mirsat proclaimed. “The traditions of\n",
      "East and West are not as divergent as you might think!”\n",
      "“Mirsat?” Brüder pressed, sounding impatient. “We’d really like to see Dandolo’s tomb,\n",
      "if we may?”\n",
      "Mirsat looked mildly annoyed, as if the man’s haste were somehow a display of\n",
      "disrespect to the building.\n",
      "“Yes,” Langdon said. “I’m sorry to rush, but we’re on a very tight schedule.”\n",
      "“Very well, then,” Mirsat said, pointing to a high balcony to their right. “Let’s head\n",
      "upstairs and see the tomb.”\n",
      "“Up?” Langdon replied, startled. “Isn’t Enrico Dandolo buried down in the crypt?”\n",
      "Langdon recalled the tomb itself, but not the precise place in the building where it was\n",
      "located. He had been picturing the dark underground areas of the building.\n",
      "Mirsat seemed confounded by the query. “No, Professor, the tomb of Enrico Dandolo is\n",
      "most certainly upstairs.”\n",
      "What the devil is going on here?\n",
      " Mirsat wondered.\n",
      "When Langdon had asked to see Dandolo’s tomb, Mirsat had sensed that the request\n",
      "was a kind of decoy. \n",
      "Nobody wants to see Dandolo’s tomb.\n",
      " Mirsat had assumed what\n",
      "Langdon really wanted to see was the enigmatic treasure directly beside Dandolo’s tomb\n",
      "—the \n",
      "Deesis Mosaic\n",
      "—an ancient Pantocrator Christ that was arguably one of the most\n",
      "mysterious pieces of art in the building.\n",
      "Langdon is researching the mosaic, and trying to be discreet about it\n",
      ", Mirsat had\n",
      "guessed, imagining that the professor was probably writing a secret piece on the \n",
      "Deesis\n",
      ".\n",
      "Now, however, Mirsat was confused. Certainly Langdon knew the \n",
      "Deesis Mosaic\n",
      " was on\n",
      "the second floor, so why was he acting so surprised?\n",
      "Unless he is indeed looking for Dandolo’s tomb?\n",
      "Puzzled, Mirsat guided them toward the staircase, passing one of Hagia Sophia’s two\n",
      "famous urns—a 330-gallon behemoth carved out of a single piece of marble during the\n",
      "Hellenistic period.\n",
      "Climbing in silence now with his entourage, Mirsat found himself feeling unsettled.\n",
      "Langdon’s colleagues did not seem like academics at all. One of them looked like a\n",
      "soldier of some sort, muscular and rigid, dressed all in black. And the woman with the\n",
      "silver hair, Mirsat sensed … he had seen her before. \n",
      "Maybe on television?\n",
      "He was starting to suspect that the purpose of this visit was not what it appeared to\n",
      "be. \n",
      "Why are they really here?\n",
      "“One more flight,” Mirsat announced cheerily as they reached the landing. “Upstairs we\n",
      "shall find the tomb of Enrico Dandolo, and of course”—he paused, eyeing Langdon—“the\n",
      "famed \n",

      "Mirsat protested loudly, but Langdon continued, dropping quickly to his knees as if\n",
      "preparing to pray at the feet of the treacherous doge.\n",
      "Next, in a move that elicited shouts of horror from Mirsat, Langdon placed his palms\n",
      "flat on the tomb and prostrated himself. As he lowered \n",
      "his face to the ground, Langdon\n",
      "realized that he looked like he was bowing to Mecca. The maneuver apparently stunned\n",
      "Mirsat, who fell mute, and a sudden hush seemed to pervade the entire building.\n",
      "Taking a deep breath, Langdon turned his head to the right and gently pressed his left\n",
      "ear to the tomb. The stone felt cold on his flesh.\n",
      "The sound he heard echoing up through the stone was as clear as day.\n",
      "My God.\n",
      "The finale of Dante’s \n",

      "Brüder vaulted the chain and crouched down beside Langdon to listen. After a moment\n",

      "Now that they could hear the water flowing downward, one question remained. \n",
      "Where\n",
      "is it flowing?\n",
      "Langdon’s mind was suddenly flooded with images of a half-submerged cavern, bathedin an eerie red light … somewhere beneath them.\n",
      "Follow deep into the sunken palace …\n",
      "for here, in the darkness, the chthonic monster waits,\n",
      "submerged in the bloodred waters …\n",
      "of the lagoon that reflects no stars.\n",
      "When Langdon stood and stepped back over the stanchions, Mirsat was glaring up at\n",
      "him with a look of alarm and betrayal on his face. Langdon stood almost a foot taller than\n",
      "the Turkish guide.\n",
      "“Mirsat,” Langdon began. “I’m sorry. As you can see, this is a very unusual situation. I\n",
      "don’t have time to explain, but I have a very important question to ask you about this\n",
      "building.”\n",
      "Mirsat managed a weak nod. “Okay.”\n",
      "“Here at Dandolo’s tomb, we can hear a rivulet of water flowing somewhere under the\n",

      "Everyone stiffened.\n",
      "“Yes,” Mirsat told them, “especially when it rains. Hagia Sophia has approximately one\n",
      "hundred thousand square feet of rooftops that need to drain, and it often takes days. And\n",
      "usually it rains again before the drainage is complete. The sounds of trickling water are\n",
      "quite common here. Perhaps you are aware that Hagia Sofia sits on vast caverns of\n",
      "water. There was a documentary even, which—”\n",
      "“Yes, yes,” Langdon said, “but do you know if the water that is audible here at\n",
      "Dandolo’s tomb flows somewhere \n",
      "specific\n",
      "?”\n",

      "Hagia Sophia flows. To the city cistern.”\n",
      "“No,” Brüder declared, stepping back over the stanchion. “We’re not looking for a\n",
      "cistern. We’re looking for a large, underground space, perhaps with columns?”\n",
      "“Yes,” Mirsat said. “The city’s ancient cistern is precisely that—a large underground\n",
      "space with columns. Quite impressive actually. It was built in the sixth century to house\n",
      "the city’s water supply. Nowadays it contains only about four feet of water, but—”\n",
      "“Where is it!” Brüder demanded, his voice echoing across the empty hall.\n",
      "“The … cistern?” Mirsat asked, looking frightened. “It’s a block away, just east of this\n",

      "“In ancient times, the cistern held the water supply,” Mirsat clarified. “But no longer.\n",
      "We modernized.”\n",
      "Brüder came to a stop under a sheltering tree, and everyone halted with him.\n",
      "“Mirsat,” Sinskey said, “you’re sure that nobody drinks the water out of the cistern?”\n",

      "If nobody comes in regular contact with the water,\n",
      "why would Zobrist choose to contaminate it?\n",
      "“When we modernized our water supply decades ago,” Mirsat explained, “the cistern\n",
      "fell out of use and became just a big pond in an underground room.” He shrugged.\n",
      "“These days it’s nothing more than a tourist attraction.”\n",

      "ventilation, so the air is quite stuffy and humid, but it’s still very popular.”\n",
      "Sinskey’s eyes locked on Brüder, and she could tell that she and the trained SRS agent\n",
      "were picturing the same thing—a dark, humid cavern filled with stagnant water in which a\n",
      "pathogen was incubating. Completing the nightmare was the presence of boardwalksover which tourists moved all day long, just above the water’s surface.\n",
      "“He created a bioaerosol,” Brüder declared.\n",

      "magnitude of this crisis.\n",
      "An airborne pathogen had been on Sinskey’s mind as a possible scenario for some time,\n",
      "and yet when she believed that the cistern was the city’s water supply, she had hoped\n",

      "spores, the bacterium that caused Legionnaires’ disease, mycotoxins, red tide, even\n",
      "human beings. Sinskey grimly pictured the virus permeating the cistern’s lagoon … and\n",

      "door was open, revealing what looked to be a stairwell. A scattering of well-dressed\n",
      "people seemed to be waiting outside under umbrellas while a doorman controlled the\n",
      "flow of guests who were descending the stairs.\n",
      "Some kind of underground dance club?\n",

      "“It’s a large indoor space,” he replied. “It is often used as a cultural center.”\n",
      "Brüder had apparently heard enough. He dashed toward the building, sidestepping his\n",
      "way through snarled traffic on Alemdar Avenue. Sinskey and the others broke into a run\n",
      "as well, close on the agent’s heels.\n",
      "When they arrived at the cistern entrance, the doorway was blocked by a handful of\n",
      "concertgoers who were waiting to be let in—a trio of women in burkas, a pair of tourists\n",
      "holding hands, a man in a tuxedo. They were all clustered together in the doorway, trying\n",
      "to keep out of the rain.\n",
      "Sinskey could hear the melodic strains of a classical music composition lilting up from\n",
      "below. \n",
      "Berlioz\n",
      ", she guessed from the idiosyncratic orchestration, but whatever it was, it\n",
      "felt out of place here in the streets of Istanbul.\n",
      "As they drew closer to the doorway, she felt a warm wind rushing up the stairs,billowing from deep inside the earth and escaping from the enclosed cavern. The wind\n",
      "brought to the surface not only the sound of violins, but the unmistakable scents of\n",
      "humidity and masses of people.\n",
      "It also brought to Sinskey a deep sense of foreboding.\n",
      "As a group of tourists emerged from the stairs, chatting happily as they exited the\n",
      "building, the doorman allowed the next group to descend.\n",
      "Brüder immediately moved to enter, but the doorman stopped him with a pleasant\n",
      "wave. “One moment, sir. The cistern is at capacity. It should be less than a minute until\n",
      "another visitor exits. Thank you.”\n",
      "Brüder looked ready to force his way in, but Sinskey placed a hand on his shoulder and\n",
      "pulled him off to one side.\n",
      "“Wait,” she commanded. “Your team is on the way and you can’t \n",
      "search this place\n",
      "alone.” She motioned to the plaque on the wall beside the door. “The cistern is\n",
      "enormous.”\n",
      "The informational plaque described a cathedral-size subterranean room—nearly two\n",
      "football fields in length—with a ceiling spanning more than a hundred thousand square\n",
      "feet and supported by a forest of 336 marble columns.\n",
      "“Look at this,” Langdon said, standing a few yards away. “You’re not going to believe\n",

      "Oh, dear God.\n",
      "The WHO director had been correct in identifying the style of the music as Romantic,\n",
      "but the piece that was being performed had not been composed by Berlioz. It was by a\n",
      "different Romantic composer—Franz Liszt.\n",
      "Tonight, deep within the earth, the Istanbul State Symphony Orchestra was performing\n",
      "one of Franz Liszt’s most famous works—the Dante Symphony—an entire composition\n",
      "inspired by Dante’s descent into and return from hell.\n",
      "“It’s being performed here for a week,” Langdon said, scrutinizing the poster’s fine\n",
      "print. “A free concert. Underwritten by an anonymous donor.”\n",
      "Sinskey suspected that she could guess the identity of the anonymous donor. Bertrand\n",
      "Zobrist’s flair for the dramatic, it seemed, was also a ruthless practical strategy. This\n",
      "week of free concerts would lure thousands more tourists than usual down into the\n",
      "cistern and place them in a congested area … where they would breathe the\n",
      "contaminated air, then travel back to their homes both here and abroad.\n",
      "“Sir?” the doorman called to Brüder. “We have room for a couple more.”\n",
      "Brüder turned to Sinskey. “Call the local authorities. Whatever we find down there,\n",

      "“Besides,” Brüder added, “I’ve seen what happens to crowds when my team marches in\n",
      "wearing hazmat suits. We’d have full-scale panic and a stampede.”\n",
      "Sinskey decided to defer to Brüder; he was, after all, the specialist and had been in\n",
      "situations like this before.\n",
      "“Our only realistic option,” Brüder told her, “is to assume it’s still safe down there, and\n",
      "make a play to contain this.”\n",
      "“Okay,” Sinskey said. “Do it.”\n",
      "“There’s another problem,” Langdon interjected. “What about Sienna?”\n",
      "“What about her?” Brüder demanded. “Whatever her intentions may be here in\n",
      "Istanbul, she’s very good with languages and possibly speaks some Turkish.”\n",
      "“So?”\n",
      "“Sienna knows the poem references the ‘sunken palace,’ ” Langdon said. “And in\n",

      "over the doorway. “… here.”\n",
      "“That’s true,” Sinskey agreed wearily. “She may have figured this out and bypassed\n",
      "Hagia Sophia altogether.”\n",
      "Brüder glanced at the lone doorway and cursed under his breath. “Okay, if she’s down\n",
      "there and plans to break the Solublon bag before we can contain it, at least she hasn’t\n",
      "been there long. It’s a huge area, and she probably has no idea where to look. And with\n",
      "all those people around, she probably can’t just dive into the water unnoticed.”\n",
      "“Sir?” the doorman called again to Brüder. “Would you like to enter now?”\n",
      "Brüder could see another group of concertgoers approaching from across the street,\n",
      "and nodded to the doorman that he was indeed coming.\n",
      "“I’m coming with you,” Langdon said, following.\n",
      "Brüder turned and faced him. “No chance.”\n",
      "Langdon’s tone was unyielding. “Agent Brüder, one of the reasons we’re in this\n",

      "possible.\n",
      "The air down here was heavier than he’d imagined.\n",
      "Langdon could see the crowd in the distance to their left. The concert was taking place\n",
      "deep in the underground space, halfway back against the far wall, its audience seated on\n",
      "an expanse of platforms. Several hundred spectators sat in concentric rings that had been\n",
      "arranged around the orchestra while a hundred more stood around the perimeter. Still\n",
      "others had taken up positions out on the near boardwalks, leaning on the sturdy railings\n",
      "and gazing down into the water as they listened to the music.\n",
      "Langdon found himself scanning the sea of amorphous silhouettes, his eyes searching\n",

      "s,\n",
      "burkas, and even tourists in shorts and sweatshirts. The cross section of humanity,\n",

      "it will be nearly impossible to spot her.\n",
      "At that moment a heavyset man moved past them, exiting up the stairs, coughing as\n",
      "he went. Brüder spun and watched him go, scrutinizing him carefully. Langdon felt a faint\n",
      "tickle in his own throat but told himself it was his imagination.\n",
      "Brüder now took a tentative step forward on the boardwalk, eyeing their numerous\n",
      "options. The path before them looked like the entrance to the Minotaur’s labyrinth. The\n",
      "single boardwalk quickly forked into three, each of those branching off again, creating a\n",

      "back to the room. “Do you see anything that looks like the area in Zobrist’s video?”\n",
      "Everything\n",

      "palace.\n",
      "As they walked, Langdon realized how easy it would be to hide overnight in this space,\n",
      "undetected. Zobrist could have done just that to make his video. Of course, if he had\n",
      "generously underwritten this week-long concert series, he also could have simply\n",

      "Not that it matters anymore.\n",
      "Brüder was striding faster now, as if subconsciously keeping pace with the symphony’s\n",
      "tempo, which had increased into a cascading series of descending semitone suspensions.\n",
      "Dante and Virgil’s descent into hell.\n",
      "Langdon intently scanned the steep, mossy walls in the distance to their right, trying to\n",
      "match them up with what they had seen in the \n",
      "video. At each new fork in the boardwalk,\n",
      "they turned right, moving farther from the crowd, heading for the cavern’s most remote\n",
      "corner. Langdon looked back and was astounded by the distance they had covered.\n",
      "They advanced at almost a jog now, passing a handful of meandering visitors, but by\n",
      "the time they entered the deepest parts of the cistern, the number of people had thinned\n",

      "Brüder and Langdon were alone.\n",
      "“It all looks the same,” Brüder despaired. “Where do we start?” Langdon shared his\n",
      "frustration. He remembered the video vividly, but nothing down here leaped out as a\n",
      "recognizable feature.\n",
      "Langdon studied the softly lit informational signs that dotted the boardwalk as they\n",
      "moved ahead. One described the twenty-one-million-gallon capacity of the room. Another\n",
      "pointed out a nonmatching pillar that had been looted from a nearby structure during\n",

      "base of the cistern’s rightmost wall.\n",
      "There before him was an incredible sight.\n",
      "Rising out of the water was a colossal carved marble block—the head of Medusa—her\n",

      "her head had been placed on her neck upside down.\n",
      "Inverted as the damned\n",

      "Langdon suspected that this carved head, which now served as a plinth supporting one\n",
      "of the columns, had probably been pillaged from elsewhere and used here as an\n",
      "inexpensive building supply. The reason for Medusa’s inverted position was no doubt the\n",

      "she began. “He was my first love. He became my mentor.”\n",
      "“I’ve already been told, Sienna,” Langdon said.\n",
      "She gave him a startled look but continued speaking, as if afraid to lose her\n",
      "momentum. “I met him at an impressionable age, and his ideas and intellect bewitched\n",
      "me. Bertrand believed, as I do, that our species \n",
      "is on the brink of collapse … that we’re\n",
      "facing a horrifying end, which is racing toward us so much faster than anyone dares\n",
      "accept.”\n",
      "Langdon made no reply.\n",
      "“My entire childhood,” Sienna said, “I wanted to save the world. And all I was ever told\n",
      "was: ‘You can’t save the world, so don’t sacrifice your happiness trying.’ ” She paused, her\n",
      "face taut, holding back tears. “Then I met Bertrand—a beautiful, brilliant man who told\n",
      "me not only that saving the world was \n",
      "possible\n",
      " … but that doing so was a moral\n",
      "imperative. He introduced me to an entire circle of like-minded individuals—people of\n",
      "staggering abilities and intellect … people who really \n",
      "could\n",
      " change the future. For the first\n",
      "time in my life, I no longer felt all alone, Robert.”\n",
      "Langdon offered a soft smile, sensing the pain in her words.\n",
      "“I’ve endured some terrible things in my life,” Sienna continued, her voice increasingly\n",
      "unsteady. “Things I’ve had trouble moving past …” She broke his gaze and ran an anxiouspalm across her bald scalp before collecting herself and turning back to him. “And maybe\n",
      "that’s why the only thing that keeps me going is my belief that we are capable of being\n",
      "better than we are … capable of taking action to avoid a catastrophic future.”\n",
      "“And Bertrand believed that, too?” Langdon asked.\n",
      "“Absolutely. Bertrand had boundless hope for humankind. He was a Transhumanist who\n",
      "believed we are living on the threshold of a glittering ‘posthuman’ age—an era of true\n",
      "transformation. He had the mind of a futurist, eyes that could see down the road in ways\n",
      "few others could even imagine. He understood the astonishing powers of technology and\n",
      "believed that in the span of several generations, our species would become a different\n",
      "animal entirely—genetically enhanced to be healthier, smarter, stronger, even more\n",
      "compassionate.” She paused. “Except for one problem. He didn’t think we’d live long\n",
      "enough as a species to realize that possibility.”\n",
      "“Due to overpopulation …” Langdon said.\n",
      "She nodded. “The Malthusian catastrophe. Bertrand used to tell me he felt like St.\n",
      "George trying to slay the chthonic monster.”\n",
      "Langdon didn’t follow her meaning. “Medusa?”\n",
      "“Metaphorically, yes. Medusa and the entire class of chthonic deities live underground\n",
      "because they’re associated directly with Mother Earth. In allegory, chthonics are always\n",
      "symbols of—”\n",
      "“Fertility,” Langdon said, startled that the parallel had not occurred to him earlier.\n",
      "Fruitfulness. Population\n",
      ".\n",
      "“Yes, fertility,” Sienna replied. “Bertrand used the term ‘chthonic \n",
      "monster’ to represent\n",
      "the ominous threat of our own fecundity. He described our overproduction of offspring as\n",
      "a monster looming on the horizon … a monster we needed to contain immediately, before\n",
      "it consumed us all.”\n",
      "Our own virility stalks us\n",
      ", Langdon realized. \n",
      "The chthonic monster.\n",
      " “And Bertrand\n",
      "battled this monster … how?”\n",
      "“Please understand,” she said defensively, “these are not easy problems to solve.\n",
      "Triage is always a messy process. A man who severs the leg of a three-year-old child is a\n",
      "horrific criminal … until that man is a doctor who saves the child from gangrene.\n",
      "Sometimes the only choice is the lesser of two evils.” She began tearing up again. “I\n",
      "believe Bertrand had a noble goal … but his methods …” She looked away, on the verge\n",
      "of breaking down.\n",
      "“Sienna,” Langdon whispered gently. “I need to understand all of this. I need you to\n",
      "explain to me what Bertrand did. \n",
      "What\n",
      " did he release into the world?”\n",
      "Sienna faced him again, her soft brown eyes radiating a darker fear. “He released a\n",
      "virus,” she whispered. “A very specific kind of virus.”\n",
      "Langdon held his breath. “Tell me.”\n",
      "“Bertrand created something known as a viral \n",
      "vector\n",
      ". It’s a virus intentionally designed\n",
      "to install genetic information into the cell it’s attacking.” Sienna paused to let him process\n",
      "the idea. “A vector virus … rather than \n",
      "killing\n",
      " its host cell … inserts a piece of\n",
      "predetermined DNA into that cell, essentially \n",
      "modifying\n",
      " the cell’s genome.”\n",
      "Langdon struggled to grasp her meaning. \n",
      "This virus changes our DNA?“The insidious nature of this virus,” Sienna continued, “is that none of us know it has\n",
      "infected us. No one gets sick. It causes no overt symptoms to suggest that it’s changing\n",
      "us genetically.”\n",
      "For a moment Langdon could feel the blood pulsing in his veins. “And what \n",
      "changes\n",
      "does it make?”\n",
      "Sienna closed her eyes for a moment. “Robert,” she whispered, “as soon as this virus\n",
      "was released into the cistern’s lagoon, a chain reaction began. Every person who\n",
      "descended into that cavern and breathed the air became infected. They became viral\n",
      "hosts … unwitting accomplices who transferred the virus to others, sparking an\n",
      "exponential proliferation of disease that will now have torn across the planet like a forest\n",
      "fire. By now, the virus will have penetrated the global population. You, me … \n",
      "everyone\n",
      ".”\n",
      "Langdon rose from the bench and began pacing frantically before her. “And what does\n",
      "it \n",
      "do\n",
      " to us?” he repeated.\n",
      "Sienna was silent for a long moment. “The virus has the ability to render the human\n",
      "body … infertile.” She shifted uncomfortably. “Bertrand created a sterility plague.”\n",
      "Her words struck Langdon hard. \n",
      "A virus that makes us infertile\n",
      "? Langdon knew there\n",
      "existed viruses that could cause sterility, but a highly contagious airborne pathogen that\n",
      "could do so by altering us \n",
      "genetically\n",
      " seemed to belong in another world … some kind of\n",
      "Orwellian dystopia of the future.\n",
      "“Bertrand often theorized about a virus like this,” Sienna said quietly, “but I never\n",
      "imagined he would attempt to create it … much less succeed. When I got his letter and\n",
      "learned what he had done, I was in shock. I tried desperately to find him, to beg him to\n",
      "destroy his creation. But I arrived too late.”\n",
      "“Hold on,” Langdon interjected, finally finding his voice. “If the virus makes \n",
      "everyone\n",
      "on earth infertile, there will be no new generations, and the human race will start dying\n",
      "out … immediately.”\n",
      "“Correct,” she responded, her voice sounding small. “Except extinction was not\n",
      "Bertrand’s goal—quite the opposite, in fact—which is why he created a \n",
      "randomly\n",
      "activating virus. Even though Inferno is now endemic in all human DNA and will be\n",
      "passed along by all of us from this generation forward, it will ‘activate’ only in a certain\n",
      "percentage of people. In other words, the virus is now carried by everyone on earth, and\n",
      "yet it will cause sterility in only a randomly selected \n",
      "part\n",
      " of the population.”\n",
      "“What … \n",
      "part\n",
      "?” Langdon heard himself say, incredulous even to be asking such a\n",
      "question.\n",
      "“Well, as you know, Bertrand was fixated on the Black Death—the plague that\n",
      "indiscriminately killed one third of the European population. Nature, he believed, knew\n",
      "how to cull itself. When Bertrand did the math on infertility, he was exhilarated to\n",
      "discover that the plague’s death rate of \n",
      "one in three\n",
      " seemed to be the precise ratio\n",
      "required to start winnowing the human population at a manageable rate.”\n",
      "That’s monstrous\n",
      ", Langdon thought.\n",
      "“The Black Plague thinned the herd and paved the way for the Renaissance,” she said,\n",
      "“and Bertrand created Inferno as a kind of modern-day catalyst for global renewal—a\n",
      "Transhumanist Black Death—the difference being that those manifesting the disease,rather than perishing, would simply become infertile. Assuming Bertrand’s virus has taken\n",
      "hold, one third of the world’s population is now sterile … and one third of the population\n",
      "will continue to be sterile for all time. The effect \n",
      "would be similar to that of a recessive\n",
      "gene … which gets passed along to all offspring, and yet exerts its influence in only a\n",
      "small percentage of them.”\n",
      "Sienna’s hands were shaking as she continued. “In Bertrand’s letter to me, he sounded\n",
      "quite proud, saying he considered Inferno to be a very elegant and humane resolution of\n",
      "the problem.” Fresh tears formed in her eyes, and she wiped them away. “Compared to\n",
      "the virulence of the Black Death, I admit there is some compassion in this approach.\n",
      "There will be no hospitals overflowing with the sick and dying, no bodies rotting in the\n",
      "streets, and no anguished survivors enduring the death of loved ones. Humans will simply\n",
      "stop having so many babies. Our planet will experience a steady reduction in our birth\n",
      "rate until the population curve actually inverts, and our total numbers begin to decrease.”\n",
      "She paused. “The result will be far more potent than the plague, which only briefly curbed\n",
      "our numbers, creating a temporary dip in the graph of human expansion. With Inferno,\n",
      "Bertrand created a long-term solution, a permanent solution … a \n",
      "Transhumanist\n",
      " solution.\n",
      "He was a germ-line genetic engineer. He solved problems at the root level.”\n",
      "“It’s genetic terrorism …” Langdon whispered. “It’s changing who we are, who we’ve\n",
      "always been, at the most fundamental level.”\n",
      "“Bertrand didn’t see it that way. He dreamed of fixing the fatal flaw in human evolution\n",
      "… the fact that our species is simply too prolific. We are an organism that, despite our\n",
      "unmatched intellect, cannot seem to control our own numbers. No amount of free\n",
      "contraception, education, or government enticement works. We keep having babies …\n",
      "whether we want to or not. Did you know the CDC just announced that nearly \n",
      "half\n",
      " of all\n",
      "pregnancies in the U.S. are unplanned? And, in underdeveloped nations, that number is\n",
      "over seventy percent!”\n",
      "Langdon had seen these statistics before and yet only now was he starting to\n",
      "understand their implications. As a species, humans were like the rabbits that were\n",
      "introduced on certain Pacific islands and allowed to reproduce unchecked to the point that\n",
      "they decimated their ecosystem and finally went extinct.\n",
      "Bertrand Zobrist has redesigned our species … in an attempt to save us … transforming\n",
      "us into a less fruitful population.\n",
      "Langdon took a deep breath and stared out at the Bosporus, feeling as ungrounded as\n",
      "the boats sailing in the distance. The sirens were growing still louder, coming from the\n",
      "direction of the docks, and Langdon sensed that time was running out.\n",
      "“The most frightening thing of all,” Sienna said, “is \n",
      "not\n",
      " that Inferno \n",
      "causes sterility, but\n",
      "rather that it has the \n",
      "ability\n",
      " to do so. An airborne viral vector is a quantum leap—years\n",
      "ahead of its time. Bertrand has suddenly lifted us out of the dark ages of genetic\n",
      "engineering and launched us headlong into the future. He has unlocked the evolutionary\n",
      "process and given humankind the ability to redefine our species in broad, sweeping\n",
      "strokes. Pandora is out of the box, and there’s no putting her back in. Bertrand has\n",
      "created the keys to modify the human race … and if those keys fall into the wrong hands,\n",
      "then God help us. This technology should \n",
      "never\n",
      " have been created. As soon as I readBertrand’s letter explaining how he had achieved his goals, I burned it. Then I vowed to\n",
      "find his virus and destroy all traces of it.”\n",
      "“I don’t understand,” Langdon declared, his voice laced with anger. “If you wanted to\n",
      "destroy the virus, why didn’t you cooperate with Dr. Sinskey and the WHO? You should\n",
      "have called the CDC or \n",
      "someone\n",

      "“You can’t be serious! Government agencies are the \n",

      "have access to this technology! Think about it, Robert. Throughout all of human history,\n",
      "every groundbreaking technology ever discovered by science has been \n",
      "weaponized\n",
      "—from\n",
      "simple fire to nuclear power—and almost \n",
      "always\n",
      " at the hands of powerful governments.\n",
      "Where do you think our biological weapons come from? They originate from research\n",
      "done at places like the WHO and CDC. Bertrand’s technology—a pandemic virus used as a\n",

      "we can’t yet even imagine, including \n",
      "targeted\n",
      " biological weapons. Imagine a pathogen\n",
      "that attacks only those people whose genetic code contains certain ethnic markers. It\n",

      "In the distance Langdon could hear the whine of a helicopter shatter the air. He peered\n",
      "through the trees back in the direction of the Spice Bazaar and saw the running lights of\n",
      "an aircraft skimming up over the hill and streaking toward the docks.\n",
      "Sienna tensed. “I need to go,” she said, standing up and glancing to the west toward\n",
      "Atatürk Bridge. “I think I can get across the bridge on foot, and from there reach—”\n",

      "“Robert, I came back because I felt I owed you an explanation. Now you have it.”\n",
      "“No, Sienna,” Langdon said. “You came back because you’ve been running your whole\n",

      "Sienna seemed to shrink before him. “What choice do I have?” she asked, watching the\n",

      "Twenty minutes earlier, Langdon had contacted Sinskey by phone and explained that\n",

      " As improbable and\n",
      "horrifying as the prospect sounded, she had to admit there was an eerie logic to it. After\n",
      "all, Zobrist was a genetic engineer and knew firsthand that the smallest mutation in a\n",
      "single gene could have catastrophic effects on the body—cancers, organ failure, and\n",
      "blood disorders. Even a disease as abhorrent as cystic fibrosis—which drowns its victim in\n",
      "mucus—was caused by nothing more than a minuscule hiccup in a regulator gene on\n",

      "Langdon exhaled, standing now. “I think you should listen to me. Shortly before his\n",

      "“I know it’s asking a lot, in light of her actions, but rather than castigating \n",
      "her, it might\n",
      "be helpful to remember that Sienna has a unique intellect, including a rather startling\n",

      "“If everything you’re saying is true, then you have my word.” Sinskey pushed the phone\n",
      "toward him. “Please make the call.”\n",
      "To Sinskey’s surprise, Langdon ignored the phone. Instead, he stood up and headed\n",
      "out the door, stating that he would be back in a minute. Puzzled, Sinskey walked into the\n",
      "hall and observed him striding through the consulate’s waiting area, pushing open the\n",
      "glass doors, and exiting into the elevator foyer beyond. For a moment, she thought he\n",
      "was leaving, but then, rather than summoning the elevator, he slipped quietly into the\n",
      "women’s restroom.\n",
      "A few moments later, he emerged with a woman who looked to be in her early thirties.\n",
      "Sinskey needed a long moment to accept the fact that this was truly Sienna Brooks. The\n",
      "pretty ponytailed woman she had seen earlier in the day had been utterly transformed.\n",
      "She was totally bald, as if her scalp had been shaved clean.\n",
      "When the two entered her office, they silently took seats facing the desk.\n",
      "“Forgive me,” Sienna said quickly. “I know we have a lot to discuss, but first, I was\n",
      "hoping you would permit me to say something that I really need to say.”\n",
      "Sinskey noted the sadness in Sienna’s voice. “Of course.”\n",
      "“Ma’am,” she began, her voice frail, “you are the director of the World HealthOrganization. You know better than anyone that we are a species on the edge of collapse\n",
      "… a population out of control. For years, Bertrand Zobrist attempted to engage with\n",
      "influential people like yourself to discuss the impending crisis. He visited countless\n",
      "organizations \n",
      "that he believed could effect change—Worldwatch Institute, the Club of\n",
      "Rome, Population Matters, the Council on Foreign Relations—but he never found anyone\n",
      "who dared engage in a meaningful conversation about a \n",
      "real\n",
      " solution. You all responded\n",
      "with plans for better contraceptive education, tax incentives for smaller families, and\n",
      "even talk of colonizing the moon! It’s no wonder Bertrand lost his mind.”\n",
      "Sinskey stared at her, offering no reaction.\n",
      "Sienna took a deep breath. “Dr. Sinskey, Bertrand came to you personally. He begged\n",
      "you to acknowledge that we are on the brink … begged you to engage in some kind of\n",
      "dialogue. But rather than listening to his ideas, you called him a madman, put him on a\n",
      "watch list, and drove him underground.” Sienna’s voice grew heavy with emotion.\n",
      "“Bertrand died all alone because people like yourself refused to open your minds enough\n",
      "even to admit that our catastrophic circumstances might actually require an\n",
      "uncomfortable solution. All Bertrand ever did was speak the truth … and for that, he was\n",
      "ostracized.” Sienna wiped her eyes and gazed across the desk at Sinskey. “Believe me, I\n",
      "know what it’s like to feel all alone … the worst kind of loneliness in the world is the\n",
      "isolation that comes from being misunderstood. It can make people lose their grasp on\n",
      "reality.”\n",
      "Sienna stopped talking, and a strained silence followed.\n",
      "“That’s all I wanted to say,” she whispered.\n",
      "Sinskey studied her for a long while and then sat down. “Ms. Brooks,” she said, as\n",
      "calmly as possible, “you’re right. I may not have listened before …” She folded her hands\n",

      "One third of the human population will be infertile.\n",

      "that Zobrist had actually created an airborne vector virus. Next she had displayed fleeting\n",
      "hope when she learned that the virus was not designed to \n",
      "kill\n",
      " people. Then … slowly,\n",
      "there had been the spiraling horror as the truth set in, and she realized that vast portions\n",

      "the virus attacked human \n",
      "fertility\n",
      " affected Sinskey on a deeply personal level.\n",

      "way—penicillin, anesthesia, X-rays, the first time humans looked through a microscope\n",
      "and saw a cell divide.\n",
      "Dr. Sinskey gazed down at her notepad. “In a few hours, I will arrive in Geneva to a\n",

      " in order to change our DNA back to its original\n",

      "hear your thoughts on that approach.”\n",
      "My thoughts?\n",

      "You’ve come this far. Speak your mind. Tell the\n",
      "truth as you see it.\n",

      "“Ma’am, the world of genetic engineering is one I’ve inhabited with Bertrand for many\n",
      "years. As you know, the human genome is an extremely delicate structure … a house of\n",
      "cards. The more adjustments we make, the greater the chances we mistakenly alter the\n",
      "wrong card and bring the entire thing crashing down. My personal belief is that there is\n",
      "enormous danger in attempting to undo what has already been done. Bertrand was a\n",
      "genetic engineer of exceptional skill and vision. He was years ahead of his peers. At this\n",
      "point in time, I’m not sure I would trust anyone else to go poking around in the human\n",
      "genome, hoping to get it right. Even if you designed something you thought might work,\n",

      "reinfecting\n",
      " the entire population with something new.”\n",
      "“Very true,” Sinskey said, seeming unsurprised by what she had just heard. “But of\n",
      "course, there is the bigger issue. We might not even \n",
      "want\n",
      " to counteract it.”\n",
      "Her words caught Sienna off guard. “I’m sorry?”\n",
      "“Ms. Brooks, I may disagree with Bertrand’s methods, but his assessment of the state\n",
      "of the world is accurate. This planet is facing a serious overpopulation issue. If we\n",
      "manage to neutralize Bertrand’s virus without a viable alternate plan … we are simply\n",
      "back at square one.”\n",
      "Sienna’s shock must have been apparent, because Sinskey gave her a tired chuckle and\n",
      "added, “Not a viewpoint you expected to hear from me?”\n",
      "Sienna shook her head. “I guess I’m not sure what to expect anymore.”\n",
      "“Then perhaps I can surprise you again,” Sinskey went on. “As I mentioned earlier,\n",
      "leaders from top health agencies around the world will be gathering in Geneva in a\n",
      "matter of hours to discuss this crisis and prepare an action plan. I can’t recall a gathering\n",
      "of greater significance in all my years at the WHO.” She leveled her gaze at the young\n",

      "you\n",
      " to have a seat at that table.”\n",
      "“Me?” Sienna recoiled. “I’m not a genetic engineer. I’ve told you everything I know.”\n",
      "She pointed to Sinskey’s notepad. “Everything I have to offer is right there in your notes.”\n",
      "“Not by a long shot,” Langdon interjected. “Sienna, any meaningful debate about this\n",

      "context\n",

      "framework to assess their response to this crisis. She obviously believes you are in a\n",
      "unique position to add to that dialogue.”\n",
      "“My moral framework, I suspect, will not please the WHO.”\n",
      "“Probably not,” Langdon replied, “which is all the more reason for you to be there. You\n",
      "are a member of a new breed of thinkers. You provide counterpoint. You can help them\n",
      "understand the mind-set of visionaries like Bertrand—brilliant individuals whose\n",
      "convictions are so strong that they take matters into their own hands.”“Bertrand was hardly the first.”\n",
      "“No,” Sinskey interjected, “and he won’t be the last. Every month, the WHO uncovers\n",
      "labs where scientists are dabbling in the gray areas of science—everything from\n",
      "manipulating human stem cells to breeding chimeras … blended species that don’t exist\n",
      "in nature. It’s disturbing. Science is progressing so fast that nobody knows where the\n",
      "lines are drawn anymore.”\n",
      "Sienna had to agree. Just recently, two very respected virologists—Fouchier and\n",
      "Kawaoka—had created a highly pathogenic mutant H5N1 virus. Despite the researchers’\n",
      "purely academic intent, their new creation possessed certain capabilities that had\n",
      "alarmed biosecurity specialists and had created a firestorm of controversy online.\n",
      "“I’m afraid it’s only going to get murkier,” Sinskey said. “We’re on the verge of new\n",
      "technologies that we can’t yet even imagine.”\n",
      "“And new philosophies as well,” Sienna added. “The Transhumanist movement is about\n",
      "to explode from the shadows into the mainstream. One of its fundamental tenets is that\n",
      "we as humans have a moral obligation to \n",
      "participate\n",
      " in our evolutionary process … to use\n",
      "our technologies to advance the species, to create better humans—healthier, stronger,\n",
      "with higher-functioning brains. Everything will soon be possible.”\n",
      "“And you don’t think that such beliefs are in conflict with the evolutionary process?”\n",
      "“No,” Sienna responded without hesitation. “Humans have evolved incrementally over\n",
      "millennia, inventing new technologies along the way—rubbing sticks together for warmth,\n",
      "developing agriculture to feed ourselves, inventing vaccines to fight disease, and now,\n",
      "creating genetic tools to help engineer our own bodies so we can survive in a changing\n",
      "world.” She paused. “I believe genetic engineering is just another step in a long line of\n",
      "human advances.”\n",
      "Sinskey was silent, deep in thought. “So you believe we should embrace these tools\n",
      "with open arms.”\n",
      "“If we \n",
      "don’t\n",
      " embrace them,” Sienna replied, “then we are as undeserving of life as the\n",
